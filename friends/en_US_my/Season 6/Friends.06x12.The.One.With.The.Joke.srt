1
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:07,044
Hey! You're not gonna believe this.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,623
Yes, Ross, we know they have magazines
with pictures of naked women in them.

3
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:13,851
Don't tell him about the videos!

4
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:18,025
I made up a joke
and sent it in to <i>Playboy.</i>

5
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:19,822
They printed it.

6
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:24,193
I didn't know they print jokes.

7
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:27,201
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.

8
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:29,238
It's not just about the pictures.

9
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,944
Didn't work on Mom,
it's not gonna work on us.

10
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:35,243
Check it out. It's the first one.

11
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,014
Right there.

12
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:41,882
That is funny.

13
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,248
It was also funny when I made it up.

14
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,394
-What?
-I made that joke up.

15
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:50,495
No, you didn't. I did.

16
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:55,191
Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.

17
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:57,426
Hey, tell Dan thanks.

18
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:02,942
What?

19
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:06,907
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.

20
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:12,580
Monica, you remember me
telling you that joke, right?

21
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,646
-No.
-Seriously?

22
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:16,919
You tell a lot of jokes.

23
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,919
Look, it's my joke.

24
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:23,594
But if it makes you feel better,
they don't print the name.

25
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:26,264
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,865
Yeah, I guess.

27
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,400
-Hey, guys.
-<i>Playboy</i> printed my joke!

28
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:33,470
No, it's mine! Call them!
They'll tell you!

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,729
-My joke!
-My joke!

30
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,507
Jokes? What...?

32
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,272
You know there's naked chicks
in there, right?

33
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:45,710
The One With The Joke

34
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,419
Dude! You have got to turn on
<i>Behind The Music.</i>

35
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:28,253
The band Heart is having a tough
time and they may break up.

36
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,463
Let's watch that at your place.

37
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:34,100
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.

38
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,293
Hey, Chandler?
You know what we should do?

39
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:41,164
You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.

40
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,873
What? No, I want to watch this.

41
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:50,410
-Did your cable go out?
-No. No, that's VH1.

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,514
I tell you, the music
these kids listen to today...

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,210
...it's a lot of noise to me.

44
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,153
Why is your cable out?

45
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:02,920
Oh, because I haven't really
paid the bill.

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,627
If you need money,
would you please let me loan you some?

47
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,299
No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?

48
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:13,495
I know things have been tight since
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.

49
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,535
I know, yeah.

50
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:19,778
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.

51
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,039
And Ross gave me this great book.

52
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,479
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch at his place?

53
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:28,983
Sure.

54
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,558
-Paid your phone bill?
-No.

55
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,397
It's only you.

56
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,765
-What are you doing?
-Looking at a <i>Playboy.</i>

57
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,166
I want to look too!

58
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,810
Yikes!

59
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:58,782
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?

60
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:02,048
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman...

61
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,483
...she has lost her clothes.

62
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:09,718
So she rides naked on the horse,
she's crying out, "Where are they?"

63
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:14,364
She's not gonna find them,
lying in the grass like that.

64
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:21,563
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn...

65
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,934
...lift up your shirt and bend over?

66
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:31,276
You see, now, I would date this girl.

67
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:34,112
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.

68
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:37,549
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.

69
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:39,282
I got a question.

70
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:43,151
If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?

71
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:45,724
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

72
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,331
Rachel.

73
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,492
What?

74
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,037
I don't know.

75
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,104
Me neither.

76
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:02,938
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.

77
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:08,586
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.

78
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:12,318
So you heard it, you repeated it...

79
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:15,288
...so that must mean you wrote it.

80
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,094
You guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say...

81
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,130
...I know I cracked up,
but I'm not even sure I got it.

82
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,797
What?

83
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:26,800
You didn't get it?

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,736
The doctor is a monkey.

85
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,437
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.

86
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:38,644
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.

87
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:40,951
Your joke?

88
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,054
Well, I think the Hef
would disagree.

89
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,655
Which is why he sent me a check...

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,055
...for $ 100.

91
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:52,628
So you stole my joke
and you stole my money?

92
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,900
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.

93
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,069
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller...

94
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:01,171
...that I am a published writer.

95
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,467
She'll know that you stole the joke.

96
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,244
You gonna follow me there?

97
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,309
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna go now.

98
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:08,845
Okay.

99
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,017
Here you go.

100
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,350
Gunther?

101
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,359
I can't pay now,
because I'm not working.

102
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:23,221
I've had to cut down
on some luxuries like...

103
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,954
...paying for stuff, so....

104
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,693
Well, if you want, you can work here.

105
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,798
I don't know.

106
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,300
It's just....

107
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:37,038
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?

108
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:40,178
And to go from that to this,
it's just....

109
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,211
And plus, I'd have to wait
on all my friends.

110
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,210
Okay. But the money's good.

111
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:48,285
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
as much as you want.

112
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,254
What?

113
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,552
Flexible hours.

114
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:57,592
Maybe I could be a waiter.

115
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,229
Could I use the phone?

116
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:07,801
She picked Rachel.

117
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:12,444
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

118
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:15,779
He took my joke. He just took it.

119
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:19,278
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?

120
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,248
Phoebe picking Rachel.

121
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,386
Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

122
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,457
Know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.

123
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:30,460
I'm gonna get a joke journal,
you know?

124
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,131
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.

125
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,631
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?

126
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:39,200
-Picking Rachel.
-That's right.

127
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,442
Did you hear something?

128
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:47,773
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
into my brain to steal my thoughts.

129
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:50,676
It's coming from the living room.

130
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,150
I finished my book.

131
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,299
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

132
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,593
Don't you guys look cute.

133
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:12,764
You guys make a cute couple.

134
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:15,940
What are you doing?

135
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:20,203
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place.

136
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,777
Remember? When you picked
Rachel over me?

137
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,007
That was funny.

138
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,346
-It was kind of funny.
-It wasn't funny at all!

139
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,515
Why would you do that?

140
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,691
Why didn't you pick me?

141
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,291
Fine.

142
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:39,621
The reason I was leaning a little
bit more toward Rachel than you...

143
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,698
...is just, you know, you're...

144
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:44,495
...high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch!

145
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,170
That is completely untrue.

146
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,705
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.

147
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:53,536
You write out a list, and
we'll go through it point by point.

148
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,841
No, you're right, you're easygoing.

149
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:03,314
You're just not as easygoing
as Rachel. She's just more...

150
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,820
...flexible and mellow. That's all.

151
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,457
Well, people are different.

152
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:16,593
Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.

153
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:21,673
What? Are you saying that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.

154
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,035
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.

155
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:29,513
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.

156
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,581
You're not invited to lunch!

157
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,309
What do you think?
Pretty strong, I think.

158
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,817
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.

159
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,152
You start working on that list.

160
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,591
-I cannot believe her.
-I know. Where do you want to eat?

161
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,400
-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.

162
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,104
Wherever you want to go is cool.

163
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,407
Oh, hey, Gunther...

164
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:02,237
...check this out.

165
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,442
Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.

166
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:14,616
You want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.

167
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,224
-I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
-Sure.

168
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,059
-Coffee?
-No.

169
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,857
Coffee? I'm going up there.

170
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,295
No, thank you.

171
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:26,304
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.

172
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,068
I'd love ice water.

173
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,775
You got it.

174
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:32,508
What are you doing?

175
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,144
Just being friendly.

176
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:38,840
You're not supposed to go back there.

177
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,483
It's okay. Right?

178
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,983
Don't wink at me.

179
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,126
And put on your apron.

180
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:50,324
Okay.

181
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:54,226
I don't see you asking other
paying customers to put on aprons.

182
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,299
-Joey, do you work here?
-No.

183
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,028
-Waiter.
-Yeah!

184
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,277
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?

185
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:14,014
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

186
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,450
It's supposed to go
the other direction.

187
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,819
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.

188
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,288
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?

189
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:28,456
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
I might as well get paid for it.

190
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:32,001
I just feel kind of weird
serving you guys, you know?

191
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:33,330
It'll be great.

192
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,039
Come on, I did it and it was fine.

193
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,766
Why would it be weird?

194
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:40,980
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

195
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,207
It doesn't seem that weird.

196
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,147
I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.

197
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:51,050
See, now it's weird again.

198
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:55,194
You're gonna make a lot of money.
Here's your first tip.

199
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,757
Don't eat yellow snow.

200
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,861
2:15, coffeehouse.

201
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,966
This is great. Finally,
someone I can pass my wisdom to.

202
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:12,143
Let me tell you some things
I learned working here.

203
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,404
First, the customer is always right.

204
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:19,140
A smile goes a long way.

205
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:24,550
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.

206
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:27,584
Thanks, Rach.

207
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,330
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?

208
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:35,659
How about clearing out
so I can get some new customers?

209
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:37,927
It's all about turnover.

210
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,141
Seriously, can I get my coffee?

211
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,701
I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.

212
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:50,079
And since you waited,
I'll toss in a free muffin.

213
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,480
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.

214
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay.

215
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:03,585
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.

216
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:06,730
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.

217
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,660
But you know what you are?

218
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:12,598
We are sorry to tell you this,
but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

219
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:17,940
That's true, I am flaky.

220
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:23,041
So, what, you're just okay
with being flaky?

221
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,874
Yeah, totally.

222
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:28,276
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.

223
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:31,389
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.

224
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,952
That's great. Good for you guys.

225
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,390
-I am not high maintenance!
-I am not a pushover!

226
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:41,128
-Who said you were?
-You did!

227
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,768
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.

228
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,273
Hey, Gunther.

229
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,843
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.

230
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,648
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.

231
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,349
I like your natural color.

232
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:06,258
It's a great part.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.

233
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,824
I wait for him and save his seat.
Listen.

234
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:12,161
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved."

235
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,429
-That's the whole part?
-Maybe he's not his best friend.

236
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:19,896
I'll see you.

237
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:22,798
Oh, man.

238
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:26,842
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken."

239
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:30,378
-Excuse me.
-No, I didn't mean you.

240
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,947
But you believed me?

241
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:35,981
I believed you were saving this seat
for someone.

242
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,347
So you'd hire me, right?

243
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:41,223
For what?

244
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:44,490
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!

245
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:47,461
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.

246
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,826
What?

247
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:51,702
It's for the kids.

248
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:54,668
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.

249
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:58,502
It's a very important issue
in this month's <i>Playboy.</i>

250
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,609
I'm sure you all read about it.

251
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:06,742
Hey! Don't you wanna keep guns
away from kids?

252
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,082
-You said, "drugs."
-It's a vicious cycle. Get out!

253
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,449
Go!

254
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,467
-It's my joke.
-It's my joke.

255
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,542
It's my joke.

256
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,379
I don't think we're gonna settle this.

257
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:40,280
Let's have Monica decide.

258
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,545
-Hey, Mon!
-Get out here!

259
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,756
-Monica?
-Okay.

260
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:47,289
You have to decide whose joke this is.

261
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,550
Why do I have to?

262
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,922
You're the only one that can be fair.

263
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,062
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.

264
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,393
But I'm your brother. We're family.

265
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:59,435
That's the most important thing
in the world.

266
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,203
Don't try to sway her.

267
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,443
I'm your only chance to have a baby.

268
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,750
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

269
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:15,613
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke...

270
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:19,847
...then you decide which one of us
is telling the truth. Me.

271
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,754
Chandler, you first.

272
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:25,395
I thought of the joke two months ago
at lunch with Steve.

273
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,122
-Did I meet him at Christmas?
-Can I finish?

274
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,868
You want me to pick you?

275
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:34,402
See, I would never
snap at you like that.

276
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,777
<i>Two babies.</i>

277
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:43,976
-Continue.
-Okay.

278
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:48,916
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.

279
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:54,182
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

280
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,155
Are you kidding?

281
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,232
Okay, look, I study evolution.

282
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,868
Remember? Evolution.

283
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,695
Monkey into man.

284
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,599
Plus, I'm a doctor. And...

285
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,877
...I had a monkey.

286
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,980
I'm Dr. Monkey!

287
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:21,083
I'm not arguing with that.

288
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,445
I've heard enough for my decision.

289
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,281
-Okay, so what--?
-Do tell.

290
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,754
You are both idiots.

291
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,990
It's not funny.
And it's offensive to women.

292
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,325
And doctors. And monkeys.

293
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,860
You shouldn't argue
over who gets credit.

294
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:43,039
You should argue over who gets blamed
for inflicting this joke on the world.

295
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:44,674
Now, let it go.

296
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:47,038
The joke sucks.

297
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,516
-It's your joke.
-It is not.

298
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:13,361
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
-Hi.

299
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,131
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

300
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,806
Why don't you tell them...

301
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,537
...what you told me about me
not being high maintenance.

302
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,218
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.

303
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:32,990
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.

304
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:38,258
And what may be perceived
as high maintenance...

305
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,158
...is merely attention to detail...

306
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:42,732
...and...

307
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:46,167
...generosity of spirit.

308
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:52,772
Wow. You know what? That is the best
fake speech I think I've ever heard.

309
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,740
Really? I've heard better.

310
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,875
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.

311
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,143
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?

312
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:04,322
Look, I am not high maintenance!

313
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,421
I am not. Chandler!

314
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:11,153
You're a little high maintenance.

315
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,558
You are on my list!

316
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,158
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not--

317
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:20,167
You're not easygoing,
but you're passionate.

318
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,667
And that's good.

319
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:25,809
And when you get upset about little
things, I think I'm pretty good...

320
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:27,909
...at making you feel better.

321
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:31,082
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance...

322
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,945
...but it's okay, because I like...

323
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,645
...maintaining you.

324
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,388
I didn't tell him that.

325
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,332
-You're off my list.
-I'm off the list.

326
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,001
Phoebe?

327
00:19:57,276 --> 00:20:00,439
It's okay that you don't want me
to be your girlfriend.

328
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,374
I have the best boyfriend.

329
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:07,343
You know,
suddenly I find you very attractive.

330
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,013
How'd the audition go?

331
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,656
Oh, not good. No.

332
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,556
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so....

333
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,696
Wow, that is a bad audition.

334
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,392
Well, how did you lose your job here?

335
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,967
I had the audition...

336
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:29,800
...but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.

337
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,168
So I went anyway, and he fired me.

338
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:35,346
He left work
to do a personal errand...

339
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:38,881
...and left you in charge
when you've been here two days?

340
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,415
That's not right.

341
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,820
What are you gonna do?

342
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,718
You can't let him get away with that.

343
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,086
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say--

344
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:52,626
I shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something!

345
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:59,062
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.

346
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:02,966
-It's not fair that you have to fire--
-Okay.

347
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,113
-What?
-He can have his job back.

348
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:13,585
That's right,
he can have his job back.

349
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,588
Glad we got that all straightened out.

350
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:20,256
There you go, Joey.

351
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,895
-Got your job back.
-That's great. Thanks.

352
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,962
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?

353
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,895
-Rach, you're in my seat.
-I'm sorry.

354
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:38,234
I never heard who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.

355
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:41,880
-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
-Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.

356
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,706
Yeah, I kind of thought.

357
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,047
-<i>Never.</i>
-<i>It would totally be you.</i>

358
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,624
If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with...

359
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:57,327
...who would you pick?

360
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,961
-No way.
-I'm not answering.

361
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,721
Joey.

362
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:06,162
No way, I'm not answering that.
