1
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:05,681
Okay, Rach, that's muffin
and espresso, $4.50.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,379
Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.

3
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:13,024
And Pheebs, herbal tea, $ 1.25.

4
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:15,921
All together that's $ 12.75.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,562
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.

6
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,960
How much do I owe you?

7
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:27,401
That's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

8
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,540
Great. Well, tell him thanks.

9
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,837
And since Joey seems like
such a nice guy...

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:35,548
...maybe we could go out?

11
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:38,307
He's not used to women
being so forward...

12
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:41,418
...but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.

13
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,553
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

14
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,061
How come our stuff isn't free?

15
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:51,526
It will be when you look like
that in a tight skirt.

16
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:54,057
I'm getting more dates than ever.

17
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,270
You're only giving free stuff
to the pretty girls?

18
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:59,437
Joey, that is so gross!

19
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:02,471
How about a scone on the house, baby?

20
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:05,638
I'm pretty.

21
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,982
The One With Rachel's Sister

22
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:48,986
-Hey, does anyone have any gum?
-I do.

23
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,350
Here. Sorry.

24
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:56,126
Oh, you know what?

25
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,025
No.

26
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:02,933
Wait a second.

27
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:12,177
-I know it's in here.
-You know what? I'm good.

28
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,676
Sorry, I guess it's in my big bag.

29
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,578
Say, does anybody have a goldfish?

30
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,789
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

31
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:29,120
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.

32
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:32,589
-Sorry you're sick.
-I'm not sick!

33
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:39,005
I don't get sick. Getting sick is
for weaklings, it's for pansies.

34
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,334
No one thinks that you're a pansy...

35
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,374
...but we do think
that you need a tissue.

36
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,246
I have not been sick
in over three years.

37
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:55,983
I think you're sick because
that used to be in your nose.

38
00:02:58,592 --> 00:02:59,718
I'll get tissue.

39
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:03,019
I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.

40
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:05,788
When you put a D
at the end of fine...

41
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,123
...you're not fine.

42
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:10,970
I'm fine-d.

43
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:14,163
I'm fine-d.

44
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,576
It's a really hard word to say.

45
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:33,451
-Yes?
-Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,854
Oh, my God, Jill!

47
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,989
Oh, my God, Rachel!

48
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:40,091
Oh, my God, introduce us.

49
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,863
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.

50
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,338
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.

51
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,330
-How you doing?
-Don't!

52
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,840
Honey, what are you doing here?

53
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,209
Which sister is this?

54
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:00,419
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

55
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:01,881
Daddy cut me off.

56
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,612
Never mind, I got it.

57
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,523
You know what I said?

58
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:09,193
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer,
sue you, take all your money...

59
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:10,929
...and cut you off!"

60
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:12,630
Wow. What did he say?

61
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,629
That he wouldn't pay
for my lawyer.

62
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,537
Then he told me to learn
the value of money...

63
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:21,330
...from the one daughter
he's actually proud of.

64
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,974
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.

65
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,645
My dad's proud of me.

66
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,142
-Rach?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

67
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,750
Honey, so what did you do
that made Dad cut you off?

68
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,155
Okay, I bought a boat.

69
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:37,856
You bought a boat?

70
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,550
It wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.

71
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,463
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.

72
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,097
I knew it was stupid and
I shouldn't have done it...

73
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,432
...but she bought me all these CDs
and said I had a cute haircut.

74
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:56,040
And your daddy didn't understand?

75
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,305
I know, and usually I just cry
and say I'm sorry and he forgives me.

76
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,280
Oh, yes, good criers, the Green girls.

77
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:10,081
I mean, the Green sisters.

78
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,958
Man, no matter how you say it...

79
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:17,756
...it still sounds like you're
talking about green people.

80
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,259
I'm at rock bottom.

81
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:25,666
This is the best thing that
could've happened to you.

82
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:28,065
You've needed to get out on your own.

83
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:32,301
When I did it, at first I was scared,
but then look at me now.

84
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,810
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.

85
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:40,413
I can't believe him.
How does he expect me to buy stuff?

86
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,579
Maybe, you know, you
won't buy stuff for a while.

87
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,691
I don't understand.

88
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,356
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.

89
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,496
You're gonna get an apartment.

90
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,896
And then you will live off
the money that you earn.

91
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,935
Okay, I know this is what you did...

92
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,334
...but that doesn't sound like me.

93
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,409
Okay, but it can be. It can be you.

94
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:06,602
And you can stay with us.
Right, Pheebs?

95
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,374
-Of course, yeah.
-Oh, that's so great!

96
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:13,211
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.

97
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,581
Oh, I like cars.

98
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,318
-You all finished?
-Yes.

99
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,029
Great.

100
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,302
Okay, here are the tips
for this morning.

101
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:35,563
Jen gets 50, 50 for me
and Joey owes 8 dollars.

102
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,405
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.

103
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:42,547
If it's free, how come
you're charging me for it?

104
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,717
We don't give anything away
unless it's a birthday.

105
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:50,413
What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?

106
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:52,680
No.

107
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,290
Sorry.

108
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:01,525
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.

109
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,036
How did you pay? I thought
your dad took your credit card.

110
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,832
I memorized those numbers
when I was 15.

111
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,245
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!

112
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:16,414
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.

113
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:20,710
And these are my "Don't you want
to rent me this apartment?" pants.

114
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:26,555
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
qualify as making it on your own.

115
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:29,918
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
all technical.

116
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:33,388
Rachel's not gonna think
it's a good idea.

117
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:37,703
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!

118
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,572
What's going on?

119
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,308
Jill!

120
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,743
Did you shop?

121
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:47,946
No.

122
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:49,341
They did.

123
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,678
Yeah, we went shopping!

124
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,653
You went shopping?

125
00:07:56,856 --> 00:08:00,019
Then you came here
and paraded it under Jill's nose...

126
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:02,954
...when you know she's trying to quit.
That's terrible.

127
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:05,496
Sorry, Jill.

128
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,132
So, what'd you get?

129
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,666
Oh, well, all right. Thank you.

130
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:15,635
I got this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.

131
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,844
And then I got....
These are apartment pants.

132
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,974
Apartment pants?

133
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,918
You've never heard of them?

134
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,913
Of course I've heard of them.

135
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:33,985
Ross, what'd you get?

136
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,625
I got this....

137
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,230
This.

138
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,165
-A pashmina?
-Yeah!

139
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:48,639
I love these babies.

140
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,736
Really?

141
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,208
What's a pashmina?

142
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,145
It's a rug.

143
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,377
Jill?

144
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,216
I'm sorry, Rachel.

145
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:10,128
You think that's gonna work on me?
I invented that.

146
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,591
Right! But I am sorry.

147
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,295
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.

148
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,903
-But don't let it happen again, okay?
-Okay.

149
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,474
Now, since Daddy paid for all this
stuff, I should take it all away.

150
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,875
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.

151
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,414
And the pants.

152
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,918
I'll take it all, because that way,
you'll learn the lesson.

153
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,055
Alrighty.

154
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,026
I'm gonna run a couple of errands
and I will see you at dinner.

155
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,301
She took all my stuff.

156
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:54,199
Yeah. Everything but
the little blue one.

157
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,737
That's the best one!

158
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,536
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!

159
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,610
Well, hey.

160
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,839
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.

161
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:08,748
Oh, yeah? How about you
with the "I'm sorry"?

162
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,116
Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.

163
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:15,488
What about what I said about
the apartment pants? How dumb was I?

164
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,962
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.

165
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:24,636
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.

166
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:28,165
Why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it?

167
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,511
Okay. So, what do you want to do?

168
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:36,113
Let's do something crazy.

169
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:39,342
I know, let's rest and drink
lots of fluids.

170
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:41,851
Okay, I'll rest.

171
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:46,617
But if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.

172
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:52,059
See, that would be impossible
to resist if you weren't all...

173
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,730
...drippy here.

174
00:10:55,702 --> 00:11:00,071
Are you saying that you don't
want to get with this?

175
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,673
I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.

176
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,275
Come on.

177
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,218
Don't take this personally.

178
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:19,186
I just can't have sex
with a sick person.

179
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:24,553
I'm with you. I can't have sex with
a sick person either. Disgusting!

180
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:25,889
But I'm not sick!

181
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,334
Let me prove it to you.

182
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:34,363
We are two healthy people
in the prime of lime.

183
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:39,701
See, that's the thing, I would like
to stay in the "prime of lime."

184
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:48,687
Oh, okay, now I'll do it.

185
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,417
Hey. What's up?

186
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:58,220
I think there's something
you should know.

187
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:00,092
Better not be about
the apartment pants.

188
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:05,464
I just pitched the idea to my boss
at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.

189
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,502
No. It's just, I was....

190
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,868
I was with Ross and Jill
after you left...

191
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:14,376
...and I'm pretty sure I saw
a little spark between them.

192
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,414
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.

193
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,950
But I wanted to warn you
that there might be something.

194
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,216
-With Ross and Jill?
-Yeah.

195
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,755
With Ross and my sister?

196
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:31,958
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

197
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,201
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.

198
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,337
Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!

199
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,941
I don't like it when he dates anyone,
but my sister?

200
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:45,167
Isn't that incest or something?

201
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,280
And they're gonna have sex.

202
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,749
Oh, no! What if he marries her too?

203
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:54,476
This is just terrible.
This is just terrible.

204
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:57,087
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.

205
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,259
And Jill should be able to do
what she wants to do.

206
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:04,395
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross
is marrying my little sister.

207
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,895
This is the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me.

208
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:12,503
But great news about
the apartment pants, huh?

209
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,465
That'll be $3.85.

210
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:19,609
What? Yesterday you said
I was too pretty to pay.

211
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:23,344
It's just, I can't,
because my manager said that l--

212
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:28,148
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

213
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,652
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

214
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,792
-<i>Happy birthday, dear Annie</i>--
-Amy!

215
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,153
--<i>Amy</i>

216
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:38,623
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

217
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:41,798
That's weird,
today's my birthday too.

218
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,866
Not in here, it isn't.

219
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,203
Sorry I'm late. What's up?

220
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:55,673
I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.

221
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:58,976
No. But I walked past three sales
and didn't go in.

222
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,412
How strong am I?

223
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:03,283
That is great.

224
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:06,922
You know who doesn't have to
job-hunt? Ross.

225
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,526
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?

226
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:13,593
So you guys talked? So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?

227
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:18,230
Me go out with Ross? No.

228
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:20,905
God, no.
What would make you think that?

229
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,633
Phoebe...

230
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,140
...said she thought she saw something
between you guys.

231
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,142
I mean, he's nice.

232
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:31,839
He's the kind you're friends with,
but not the kind you date.

233
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:35,680
He's the kind you date,
because you did. But me?

234
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,821
Not so much.

235
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:44,261
Oh, not so much. What do you mean?
Is there something wrong with Ross?

236
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:46,224
No, no, no. He's just....

237
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,399
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.

238
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,227
Are you saying he's a geek?

239
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,096
You think so too?

240
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,439
No. Ross is not a geek.

241
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,541
Then let's just say
he's not my type.

242
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,214
Handsome is not your type?

243
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:05,177
Smart, kind, good kisser.

244
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,579
What, those things aren't
on your list?

245
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,516
Ross is great.
You'd be lucky to be with him.

246
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:13,583
If it means that much,
then I'll ask him out.

247
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:16,384
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

248
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,357
You know what? You're right.

249
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,929
He has been really nice to me.

250
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,569
Yeah, but he's not your type.

251
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,768
But maybe that's good.

252
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,065
I'm doing all these different things.

253
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:31,242
Maybe I should just try
dating a geek too.

254
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:36,111
Yeah, but you don't want
to try too much too fast.

255
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:40,309
You remember what happened
to the little girl who...

256
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,611
...tried too much too fast, don't you?

257
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,382
What?

258
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,390
She died, Jill.

259
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,692
Chandler!

260
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,406
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?

261
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,241
Calling Dr. Big.

262
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,710
Dr. Big to the bed.

263
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:16,050
Jeez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.

264
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,985
How could I be asleep knowing
that you were in the next room?

265
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:23,856
I was asleep.

266
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:31,668
No, honey. You know what's sexy?
Layers.

267
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,670
Layers are sexy.

268
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:37,535
And blankets are sexy.
And hot-water bottles are sexy.

269
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:40,405
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.

270
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:44,349
I want to make you feel
as good as I feel.

271
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,077
Would you please get some rest?

272
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,948
I'm fine.

273
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,620
-You're coughing.
-No, I'm not.

274
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:58,827
No, I'm not, I'm laughing.

275
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,427
-At what?
-Just something I heard before.

276
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:10,166
-Tell me.
-No, I don't want it to spoil the mood.

277
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:18,475
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

278
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:24,156
-You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.

279
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:27,087
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 women today.

280
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:32,521
You are no longer authorized
to distribute birthday muffins.

281
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:34,799
Damn it!

282
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,370
Did you tell your sister
to ask me out?

283
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,243
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow! I mean, wow.

284
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:51,510
I think she's cute, but...

285
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,982
...I never would've thought of
going out with her. Never!

286
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:56,646
Really?

287
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:59,188
But after you said it's okay,
I figured, "Why not?"

288
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,153
Oh, so not really "never."

289
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,156
I have to say you are
a much bigger person than I am.

290
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,026
I mean, after all we've been through.

291
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,733
I wish I had a brother
to reciprocate.

292
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,809
If you ever date Monica,
you have my blessing.

293
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,534
And mine.

294
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:23,539
Chandler?

295
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:26,083
I think I'm sick.

296
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:28,376
Really?

297
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:30,678
Struck down in the "pribe of libe."

298
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:36,928
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.

299
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:39,629
Will you please rub this on my chest?

300
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,397
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.

301
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:47,970
Come on, I really need your help here.

302
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:53,402
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.

303
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:16,326
So you're just kind of
rubbing it on yourself?

304
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,134
-Yeah.
-It's nice.

305
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,207
You kidding me?
Is this turning you on?

306
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:26,943
Yes.

307
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:30,915
Is it the rubbing or the smell?

308
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,708
It's all very, very good.

309
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:39,957
So you want to go...

310
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:43,219
...mix it up?

311
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,931
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!

312
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,433
What about never sleeping
with sick people?

313
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:56,798
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.

314
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,102
Okay, if you really
want to have sex.

315
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:05,550
Worked like a charm.

316
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,046
Why are you here?

317
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,859
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?

318
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:20,622
I don't like it.

319
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,197
-Really?
-It's kind of slutty.

320
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,229
It's yours.

321
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,274
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.

322
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,174
Me too.

323
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:40,382
Hi, Jill.

324
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:41,883
Hi....

325
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:44,421
Rachel.

326
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,617
You're not at home,
you're right here.

327
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,286
Yeah, I know.

328
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,726
And I bet you thought it would
be weird. But it's not.

329
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,505
Okay.

330
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,435
So, well, I'll....

331
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,702
I'll have her home by midnight.

332
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,068
Why aren't you home yet?

333
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:32,361
Is someone there?

334
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,770
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.

335
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,173
What are you doing here?

336
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:42,341
I'm just looking out your window...

337
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:43,980
...at the view.

338
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,748
What are you guys doing?

339
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,949
We got some vapor rub in some places.

340
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:57,757
He brought her back to his apartment.

341
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:00,092
Who?

342
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:05,831
Is that your sister?

343
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:09,438
She is a slut!

344
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,979
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?

345
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:16,747
Oh, my God, he's taking off
her clothes!

346
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,343
He's taking off her coat.

347
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,813
Oh, this is just terrible.

348
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:27,154
Oh, no, it's not. It's a first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna....

349
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,690
He's gonna get some.

350
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,335
Of the glare...

351
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,467
...from the streetlight
out of his apartment.

352
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:47,639
You know, so he's closed
the drapes there...

353
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,644
...so he can have a nice, pleasant...

354
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:53,716
...conversation with
your little sister.

355
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,078
Well, I'm off to bed.

356
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:09,130
I don't feel good.

357
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:12,399
You better not get me sick.

358
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:22,105
I need some fruit
or some juice or some....

359
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,549
Or some nothing.

360
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,845
There's nothing in here.
Who took our food?

361
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:33,981
Can I interest you in a slice
of lasagna or a drumstick?

362
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,253
-No, thanks.
-Are you sure? It's on the house.

363
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:40,091
-No, thanks.
-How about going out with me Friday night?

364
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,859
-No, thanks.
-What are you gonna do.
