1
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,111
Okay, this is it.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,487
You sure you wanna do this?

3
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,957
HeIIo, Mrs. Ross.

4
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:18,391
WeII, heIIo, Mr. RacheI.

5
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,372
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God!

6
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:31,138
Come on, Pheebs, hurry!

7
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,245
Okay! Okay!

8
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:38,079
Oh, my God!
Is everybody getting married?

9
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,889
No running in the chapeI.

10
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:46,024
Hey, don't you give me
any of your-- Hey!

11
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:49,054
Why are you here?

12
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:52,459
Ross and RacheI Ieft a message.
They're getting married.

13
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:56,965
-Isn't that why you guys are here?
-Yes. Why eIse wouId we be here?

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,803
What happened?
Did we miss it?

15
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:03,337
We missed it.

16
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:06,706
Maybe you wouIdn't have
if you couId run in the chapeI!

17
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,646
I can't beIieve they got married.

18
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:11,909
I know! I didn't even know
they were dating.

19
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,587
I don't think they're as much dating
as they are...

20
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:18,122
...two bottIes of vodka waIking
around in human form.

21
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:19,553
This is insane.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,729
What's the big deaI?
It's not Iike it's a reaI marriage.

23
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,729
What?

24
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:28,735
If you marry in Vegas,
you're onIy married in Vegas.

25
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,767
If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

26
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,167
ReaIIy?

27
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:36,834
Yeah.

28
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,575
Oh, my God!

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,738
Oh, weII.

30
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,446
The One After Vegas

31
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,023
Why are we in bed together?

32
00:02:58,258 --> 00:02:59,520
I don't know.

33
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,487
-Did we--?
-I don't know.

34
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,232
Do you have any cIothes on?

35
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:09,290
Yes.

36
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:10,561
-ReaIIy?
-No.

37
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,899
But we didn't have...

38
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,139
...sex, did we?

39
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:24,573
I don't remember much
about Iast night.

40
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:28,117
It was such a bIur.

41
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,690
I remember Iaughing.
I Iaughed a Iot.

42
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,360
Then we didn't have sex.

43
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:42,526
WeII, so, what did we do Iast night?

44
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:47,064
I don't know, but I think
it was a Iot of fun.

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,504
LuckiIy, not too much fun, right?

46
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,405
-I don't think so.
-Oh, thank God.

47
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:58,139
Oh, I mean,
we were reaIIy drunk.

48
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,114
I'm gIad we didn't
do anything stupid.

49
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:01,877
TeII me about it.

50
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,760
Morning, Pheebs.

51
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:12,827
WeII, my movie has been
officiaIIy canceIed.

52
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,632
Joey, I'm so sorry.

53
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,097
You want my breakfast?

54
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,801
Too depressed to eat.

55
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,372
I'II probabIy eat in, Iike,
five minutes.

56
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,312
I'II fIy home with you.
What time is your fIight?

57
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:29,106
-What about my cab?
-I don't need that anymore.

58
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,845
You borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

59
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:36,180
I don't wanna drive back
by myseIf. I get IoneIy.

60
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,923
How about if you come with me?

61
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,525
-It's a Iong trip.
-That wouId be great.

62
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,060
We couId taIk and pIay games.

63
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:48,199
This couId be our chance
to, Iike, renew our friendship.

64
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,730
Are you asking me
to have a ''frienaissance''?

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,932
Sure?

66
00:04:55,442 --> 00:05:00,106
AII right. AIthough, I don't think we
need one. I never stopped Ioving you.

67
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:07,114
So has anybody taIked
to Dr. and Mrs. GeIIer yet?

68
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,719
They Ieft me a message.
They'II be here.

69
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,551
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

70
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:16,759
It's a buffet, man.

71
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,428
Here's where I win
aII my money back!

72
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,331
I gotta taIk to you.

73
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:25,561
Sure.

74
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:26,932
What's up?

75
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,707
Monica and I aImost got married.

76
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,349
My God!

77
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,554
That's huge!

78
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,791
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

79
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:51,058
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

80
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:55,591
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I Iove her...

81
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:59,327
...but seeing Ross and RacheI
come out of that chapeI...

82
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:04,441
...was Iike a wake-up caII that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

83
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:07,373
How do I teII her
without crushing her?

84
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,381
TeII her she's not marriage materiaI.

85
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,710
What?

86
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,421
GirIs say it to me aII the time.

87
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:25,395
And if she's anything Iike me,
she's just gonna be reIieved.

88
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,493
How do I teII him that it's too soon?

89
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,136
He's gonna think
I don't Iove him anymore.

90
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,670
-WeII, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

91
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,808
Good. I was just testing you.

92
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,141
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

93
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,473
We were just taIking about bacon.

94
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,944
No, we were taIking about tennis.

95
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,449
Tennis is more beIievabIe.

96
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,316
Thank you.

97
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:57,490
Coffee.

98
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,561
What?

99
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,766
Are we gonna taIk about
what you guys did Iast night?

100
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:15,403
What do you mean ''Iast night''?
Nothing happened Iast night.

101
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:18,744
Ross invited us aII to watch.

102
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,658
What is the matter with you?

103
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,855
We weren't gonna miss
our friends getting married.

104
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,928
Who got married?

105
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,533
You did.

106
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,896
What?

107
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:42,334
-HeIIo. We didn't get married.
-No, we didn't. That's ridi--

108
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,080
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapeI.

109
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,741
They wouId not Iet us get married
when we were that drunk.

110
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:56,012
They Iet you get married.

111
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:58,417
Most peopIe who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

112
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,826
Now, I'm drunk right now.

113
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:07,364
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

114
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,198
What are you gonna do?

115
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,836
WeII, I guess we find
a divorce Iawyer.

116
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,166
WeII, I think-- I think
Ross aIready has one.

117
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,176
Yeah, that guy's finaIIy gonna
be abIe to put in that pooI.

118
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:23,571
Okay.

119
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,777
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.

120
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,716
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...

121
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:33,425
...because we don't need
to get divorced.

122
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:36,490
-We're just gonna get an annuIment.
-An annuIment?

123
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,926
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

124
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,336
Oh, that's your thing!

125
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:46,430
What?

126
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,567
Your thing. You're the guy
who gets divorced.

127
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,811
No, no, that's not ''my thing.''

128
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:57,641
I do not Iove getting divorced.

129
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:01,177
Yes, you do. This is
your third divorce.

130
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:05,015
You Iove divorce so much,
you're probabIy gonna marry it...

131
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:10,755
...and then it won't work out,
so you're gonna have to divorce it.

132
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,827
I'm so drunk.

133
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:24,572
-You wanna pIay some Pai Gow?
-Maybe.

134
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,803
But I kind of think we shouId taIk
about Iast night.

135
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,973
That's a good idea.
I wanna taIk about Iast night too...

136
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,280
-...and I don't know what Pai Gow is.
-I see.

137
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,423
-So what shouId we do?
-I don't know.

138
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,353
I know I Iove you.

139
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:42,117
I know I Iove you.

140
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,634
Where are we on the whoIe
''going back...

141
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,828
...to where they have the marriages''
thing? I Iove you.

142
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,301
That's a good question.

143
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,268
Last night we Iet the dice decide.

144
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:01,504
We shouId Ieave it
up to fate again. I Iove you!

145
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,347
We don't get married
unIess there's a sign.

146
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,177
So say...

147
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,887
...you roII another eight,
then there's a sign...

148
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,349
...that we shouId marry.

149
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,148
Eight we get married...

150
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:16,726
...but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1 0,
1 1 , 1 2, we don't get married.

151
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:18,054
Sounds great.

152
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,158
Hey, we got a shooter.

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,526
Money, pIease.

154
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:22,928
-Ready?
-Ready.

155
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,932
Come on, eight.

156
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,037
Yes, yes, eight.

157
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:33,905
Eight, easy eight.

158
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:40,574
-I can't beIieve I roIIed an eight.
-That was so unIikeIy.

159
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,346
Let's get married.

160
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,215
I guess.

161
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,493
Last night I roIIed a hard eight.

162
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:51,561
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

163
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,464
I wanted it so bad!

164
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:58,961
Wanna go pack?

165
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,674
We're doing the right thing.

166
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,366
Of course we are.

167
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,409
We Ieft it up to fate.

168
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:11,242
If we were supposed to get married,
there wouId be a sign.

169
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:23,127
Okay, you have 1 9 questions Ieft.
Use them wiseIy.

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,266
Come on, Joey. You can't win
if you don't ask any questions!

171
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,937
-What?
-You promised me a fun road trip.

172
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:39,908
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asIeep for 5 and a haIf.

173
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:43,344
We are switching, and
you are going to drive back.

174
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:47,417
That wiII be your punishment,
you greedy sIeeper!

175
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:49,446
AII right.

176
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:52,555
And untiI then, you are going
to sing to me...

177
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:57,195
...because the radio's broken and you are
seIfish, but you have a nice voice.

178
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,323
-ReaIIy?
-Sing!

179
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:04,595
<i>I wanna rock 'n' roll all night</i>

180
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,408
<i>Man, this is a long drive.</i>

181
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,514
<i>Are my eyes open?</i>

182
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,012
<i>No!</i>

183
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:36,592
Morning.

184
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:45,372
-Hey.
-Hey, hubby.

185
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:53,514
ActuaIIy, I wanted to taIk to you
about that whoIe annuIment thing.

186
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:55,744
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

187
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,198
Okay.

188
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,765
So we'II just stay married.

189
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,232
Yes, exactIy.

190
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:16,272
And I wiII make everyone
caII me Mrs. GeIIer.

191
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,437
Wow, this is so amazing.

192
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:23,581
I reaIIy thought I'd have to
taIk you into this more.

193
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:28,452
Now I'm scared because I don't
actuaIIy think you're kidding.

194
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,752
I'm not kidding.

195
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,425
Look...

196
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:36,857
...I can't have three
faiIed marriages.

197
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,620
I can't, okay?

198
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:42,028
I am not gonna be that guy.

199
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:46,237
Okay? No, no. That is not gonna be
''my thing.''

200
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,835
So, what, we just
stay married forever?

201
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,773
I don't know.

202
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,341
I mean, I haven't worked it aII
out yet, but....

203
00:13:56,516 --> 00:14:00,680
Okay, I know it's a bit crazy--

204
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,788
How is this going
to affect you, reaIIy?

205
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,756
I mean, you fiII some form out
once in a whiIe...

206
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:14,126
...instead of checking the box ''Miss,''
you check the box that says, ''Mrs.''

207
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,268
It's right next to it.

208
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:22,068
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

209
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,004
We can stay married...

210
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:28,805
...because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

211
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,382
-No, they're right--
-Ross!

212
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,812
AII right.
Just...

213
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:38,023
...pIease take a moment here...

214
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:41,125
...and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

215
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:46,422
I am asking you to do me a favor.

216
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:52,401
You are asking me to be your wife.

217
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:57,542
And as my wife, I think
you shouId grant me this favor.

218
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,107
We did make vows.

219
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:08,319
That kid kicked me reaIIy hard.

220
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,522
WeII, you did puII his hair.

221
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:14,058
-He took my snack.
-I'm not getting into this again.

222
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,853
AII right, you know what?
Hurts reaIIy bad.

223
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,122
WeII, I toId you not to waIk. Here.

224
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,799
There. There. Okay.

225
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:32,868
-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
-No.

226
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,874
How couId you pick up a hitchhiker?

227
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:43,715
He couId be a rap-- He couId be
a rapist or a kiIIer or something.

228
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,651
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

229
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:50,191
I'm not taIking to you.
You go back to sIeep.

230
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,864
-And, you, are you a rapist?
-No.

231
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,760
Do you Iike car games?

232
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,228
Yeah, you know
the Iicense pIate game?

233
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,131
I Iove the Iicense pIate game!

234
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,271
I'II pIay. I'II pIay.

235
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,465
No, you need your sIeep.
Night-night.

236
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:14,008
Listen. I know you wanted
to taIk to me...

237
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,747
...but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

238
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,353
We register...

239
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,290
...and you get to keep
aII the presents.

240
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,059
No, Ross, come on. No, Iisten.

241
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,568
I've thought about
how to teII you this.

242
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,533
I came up with an anaIogy
about a IittIe goIdfish...

243
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,506
...in a pond that freezes over
in the winter...

244
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:42,011
...but I reaIized that was a story about
what to do when peopIe pick on you.

245
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,514
So I'm gonna actuaIIy save that
for my chiIdren's book.

246
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,178
-What's up?
-Oh, sorry.

247
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:49,854
The bottom Iine, Ross...

248
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,819
...is we cannot stay married.

249
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:57,161
-I don't know if that's true--
-Oh, but it is.

250
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,231
Okay. You know what this is?

251
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,869
This is a difference of opinion.

252
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:09,072
-When that happens in a marriage--
-Ross, come on!

253
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:12,904
This is not a marriage!
This is the worId's worst hangover!

254
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:17,374
Ross, Iisten, if you do not
get this annuIment, I wiII.

255
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:23,254
AII right.
AII right, I'II do it.

256
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:24,821
Thank you.

257
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,453
Hey, hey...

258
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:31,793
...is there any such thing
as an annuIment shower?

259
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,469
There's the train station.
This is where I get off.

260
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,969
I have your address
and phone number.

261
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:44,233
I have your name and the fact
that you're a drifter.

262
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:47,276
So baII's pretty much
in your court.

263
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,941
AII right. See you, Pheebs.

264
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:01,115
Come on, Pheebs, I can't
take this anymore.

265
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,622
PIease taIk to me.

266
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:06,961
Let me make it up to you.

267
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,435
<i>Ground control to Major Tom</i>

268
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:17,670
<i>Commencing countdown</i>
<i>Engines on</i>

269
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:22,173
<i>Take your protein pills</i>

270
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:26,315
<i>And put your helmet on</i>

271
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,220
-<i>This is</i>--
-Stop it! Stop it! No!

272
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,625
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautifuI voice.

273
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,953
Pheebs, Iook, I am so sorry.

274
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:41,894
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend...

275
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,830
...and I didn't deIiver, okay?

276
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:49,997
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

277
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:55,045
So I wiII strive to stay awake
for as Iong as I know you.

278
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,241
You can stiII sIeep
at night and stuff.

279
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:02,680
Thank you.

280
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,788
So can we pIay 20 Questions now?

281
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:08,824
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

282
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:11,654
Okay.

283
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:14,123
Is it...

284
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,733
...a kind of hot sandwich?

285
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:18,802
Yes.

286
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:21,397
Is it a meatbaII sub?

287
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,574
That is incredibIe!

288
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,008
You are the master!

289
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,080
Bug!

290
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:42,516
-Enough aIready!
-WeII, you didn't have to catch them!

291
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,860
-You Iook Iike you're--
-Don't say it!

292
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,759
Don't even think it.

293
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,261
AII right.

294
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,095
ChandIer, enjoy your handfuI.

295
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,169
ShouId we just get married?

296
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:01,107
AII the signs are teIIing us to do it.

297
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:02,644
I'm sick of the signs.

298
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:05,544
-I'm happy the way things are.
-Me too.

299
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,513
-I don't want change, do you?
-No.

300
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:10,881
Then nothing changes!
Everything stays the same!

301
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,159
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it drives me insane!

302
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,863
Jeez, reIax, it's not
Iike we're mar--

303
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,269
You know, I was thinking,
what if I...

304
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,344
...unpack here?

305
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,236
AII your stuff wouId be here.

306
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:38,677
WeII...

307
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,284
...what if aII my stuff was here?

308
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,887
Then you'd be going back
and forth aII the time.

309
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,154
Doesn't make any sense.

310
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,995
Okay.

311
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:56,729
What if we Iive together,
and you get what I'm saying?

312
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,630
Live together?

313
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,065
There've been no signs for that.

314
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,405
Me asking is kind of a sign.

315
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:13,909
Yes! Yes! Yes!

316
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,890
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

317
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,959
Here's your key. Here's your key.

318
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,790
Now go out and christen it!

319
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,431
Go out and come back in!

320
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,158
Door hasn't been Iocked
in five years, but okay.

321
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,729
-Ready?
-Ready!

322
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,467
The key broke in the Iock,
and I can't get in.

323
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,406
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

324
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,275
-This isn't a sign!
-No, it's a very oId key!

325
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,814
-It's an oId key!
-Oh, my God, it's oId!

326
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:47,913
I Iove you.

327
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,483
I Iove you.

328
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,183
Are you hugging the door right now?

329
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:01,961
No.

330
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,965
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

331
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,134
So did everything go aII right
with the annuIment?

332
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:15,313
Oh, yeah. No probIems.
It's aII taken care of.

333
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:16,811
Ross, thank you.

334
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,084
Do you wanna go see a movie?

335
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,082
-Yeah, why not?
-Pheebs?

336
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,186
No, thanks.
I've aIready seen one.

337
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:27,523
Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.

338
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,893
