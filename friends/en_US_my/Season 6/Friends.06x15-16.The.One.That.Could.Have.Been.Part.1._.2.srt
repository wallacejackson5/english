1
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:07,117
So it seems like this Internet thing
is here to stay, huh?

2
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:11,388
It's okay not to talk.

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,886
Hey, you guys, guess what.

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:17,495
-Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.
-Oh, my God.

5
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:19,923
What is the matter with you?

6
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,396
No. Barry and Mindy.

7
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,869
Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce,"
I immediately go to Ross.

8
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:31,037
Who's Barry and Mindy?

9
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:34,442
Barry was the guy that I almost married,
and Mindy was my best friend.

10
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,342
Wasn't he cheating on you with her?

11
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:39,849
But that just means he was falling
asleep on top of her instead of me.

12
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:43,588
-Why did they get divorced?
-Well, apparently...

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,554
...she caught him cheating on her
with someone else.

14
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:49,185
Isn't that sad?

15
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:54,799
Can you imagine if I'd married him?
How different would my life be?

16
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:57,697
I've always wondered
how different my life would be...

17
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,768
...if I'd never gotten divorced.

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,905
-Which time?
-The first time!

19
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:06,069
Imagine if Carol hadn't realized
she was a lesbian.

20
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:11,680
I can't.
I keep seeing it the good way.

21
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:16,786
I bet I'd still be doing my karate.

22
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:23,228
Towards the end of our marriage,
I did a lot of karate to release the tension...

23
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:26,557
...from not doing anything
else physical.

24
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,258
Maybe the problem was
you were pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."

25
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,498
What if I was still fat?

26
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,230
You wouldn't be dating me,
that's for sure.

27
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:38,103
-Sure I would.
-Come on.

28
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,645
You guys really think I'm that shallow?

29
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:42,609
No, I just think Monica
was that fat.

30
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:48,312
Hey, imagine if I'd never got fired
off <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

31
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,786
Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.

32
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:55,125
What if I had had the guts
to quit my job?

33
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:59,230
I'd probably be writing for
<i>The New Yorker,</i> being paid to be funny.

34
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:02,400
But my job's fun too.
I mean, tomorrow...

35
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,569
...I don't have to wear a tie.

36
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,069
What if I'd taken that job
at Merrill Lynch?

37
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,171
-What?
-Merrill Lynch?

38
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,744
I had a massage client who worked there,
and he said I had a knack for stocks.

39
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,245
Why didn't you take the job?

40
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,977
Because at that time, I thought that
everything that rhymed was true.

41
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,178
I thought if I worked with stocks...

42
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,892
...I'd have to live in a box
and only eat lox and have a pet fox.

43
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,792
Yeah, you don't want that
in a broker.

44
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:36,198
Do you guys think if all those things
happened, we'd still hang out?

45
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,607
The One That Could Have Been

46
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,294
Oh, my God. Rachel Green?

47
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,592
Rob Tilman!

48
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:46,997
No, no, it's me. Ross.

49
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,471
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tilman.

50
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:56,312
-No. No, no. Ross Geller.
-Of course! Monica's brother.

51
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,144
-Yeah. Right.
-Wow! How are you?

52
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,217
Good. Good. I'm married.

53
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,053
Me too!

54
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,050
-Isn't it the best?
-Oh, it's the best.

55
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,331
-So how's Monica?
-Really, really great.

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,333
Actually, she's right down the street.
You should stop by and say hi.

57
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:21,199
-I would love to.
-She'd be so excited.

58
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:22,363
-Okay.
-Come on.

59
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:24,776
Wait, don't you have
to pay for...

60
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,878
...<i>Busty Ladies</i>?

61
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:34,185
No, that's okay. Some kid asked me
to pick it up for him, but I....

62
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,953
Don't you have to give him
his money back?

63
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:46,965
Here you go, buddy.
Sorry, no porn for you.

64
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,260
Okay, let's go see Monica.

65
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:59,571
So, Monica.
Still going out with Dr. Boring, huh?

66
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,579
He's not boring. He's just....

67
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,443
He's low-key.

68
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:11,356
-Here you go, one hazelnut latte.
-Thank you.

69
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,254
You know, the hazelnut,
actually not a nut.

70
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,393
It's a seed.

71
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,698
Wow.

72
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:25,263
Can anyone else name a well-known seed
that's been masquerading as a nut?

73
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,996
Oh, dear God. Let me think.

74
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,001
What's the matter?

75
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:34,679
I got another rejection letter.

76
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:38,509
They said my writing was funny,
just not "Archie Comic" funny.

77
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,811
I gotta get back to the hospital.

78
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,684
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

79
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:49,525
By the way, the answer is:
the Brazil nut.

80
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,031
Was his question,
"What's more boring than him?"

81
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:59,332
And nice sweater vest,
by the way.

82
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:02,873
-Stop it, guys. He's sweet.
-Yeah, yeah.

83
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,511
Hey, man.
Sorry about the Archie thing.

84
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:07,304
You need me to
give you some money?

85
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:10,745
I may have no money,
but I still have my pride.

86
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:13,241
Really?

87
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,884
Joey doesn't have to give you the money.

88
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,990
-TV stars have assistants, right?
-That's an idea.

89
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:26,391
If I hire an assistant,
would you take money from her?

90
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,767
No, Joey.
Chandler could be your assistant.

91
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,130
He could answer
all your fan mail and stuff.

92
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:35,306
-That would be great! Let's do that!
-I could use the money.

93
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,567
I'd have time to write.

94
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,470
-Great. Welcome aboard!
-Okay!

95
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,771
All right. Now, I need to use the bathroom.

96
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,143
Since I don't need any assistance
in there, take a break!

97
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,611
All right.

98
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,114
-Hey.
-Hey, Phoebe.

99
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,019
Guess what. Joey just hired
Chandler to be his assistant.

100
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,351
That's so sweet.

101
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,821
Oh! Hang on!

102
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,993
Hang on!

103
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:02,827
Go!

104
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:06,929
No. No, no.
I said sell when it hits 50!

105
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:10,768
Five-oh! It's a number!
It comes after four-nine!

106
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:14,947
No, it's okay. It's okay.
You're allowed one mistake.

107
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,240
Just kidding.
You are, of course, fired.

108
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,088
Oh, what a shame.
I really liked her.

109
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,952
Hey, Mon?
Mon, look who I ran into!

110
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,992
Oh, my God, Rachel!

111
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,731
-God, you look terrific!
-So do you!

112
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:41,768
-Did you lose weight?
-You are so sweet to notice.

113
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,565
Yes, I lost 31 <i>\</i>2 pounds!

114
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,440
You remember my friend Chandler.

115
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,651
-And that's Phoebe over there.
-Hi.

116
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,550
Sit down. How long has it
been since we've seen each other?

117
00:07:56,756 --> 00:08:00,317
1987, the day after Christmas.
Sean McMahan's party.

118
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:04,996
I played you one of my songs, you know,
"Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."

119
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,194
Oh, yeah. Right.

120
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,734
-So, now, do you still do music?
-Well, sometimes.

121
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:15,567
-Come over sometime. I'll play you--
-Oh, my God!

122
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:21,379
Joey Tribbiani from <i>Days of Our Lives</i>
just walked in here!

123
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:26,247
-Rach, he's a friend of ours.
-You're friends with Dr. Drake Ramoray?

124
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,783
It's hard to be friends with Drake...

125
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:33,720
...because of his busy schedule
and the fact that he's not real.

126
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:38,686
Hey, or I could bring
my keyboard here sometime.

127
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,432
-He's coming over.
-Joey?

128
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,066
I know. Here, here.

129
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:47,536
No. This is my friend Rachel.
We went to high school together.

130
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,367
-Hi.
-Hi.

131
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,213
I love you on that show.

132
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,275
I watch you every day.

133
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:59,474
When you took out your own kidney
to save your ex-wife...

134
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,380
...even though
she tried to kill you....

135
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,021
It's always nice to meet fans.

136
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,652
-She's not crazy, is she?
-No.

137
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:12,188
So how you doing?

138
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,901
Hang on.

139
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,242
Hang on. Hang on.

140
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,403
Go!

141
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:29,009
Who's this?

142
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,308
You're gonna like working for me.

143
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:35,248
What's your name?
What kind of name is "Brindy"?

144
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,150
Stop talking.

145
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:42,555
All right, from now on
your name is Joan.

146
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,053
You can pick your own last name.

147
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,233
I can't find my pen.
Did you eat that too?

148
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:54,798
-There you are.
-Uh-oh, it's my boss.

149
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,276
Here's a list of things for you
to do today.

150
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:00,742
This is gonna be so great.
Thank you so much.

151
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,110
I gotta go to work. I'm delivering
twins today, but only one of them is mine.

152
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:14,083
"Drop off my dry cleaning.
Pick up my vitamins."

153
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,524
"Teach me how to spell vitamins."

154
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,624
"Wear in my new jeans."

155
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:24,800
-You realize what you are, don't you?
-What?

156
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,495
You're his bitch!

157
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,475
No, no! No!

158
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,277
Wait! You didn't sit on my
Kit Kats did you?

159
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,877
No, there was a little,
little dip in the market...

160
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,107
...and I lost 13 million dollars.

161
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,378
But the Kit Kats are all right?

162
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:45,189
What am I gonna do?
I can't call my office, they'll kill me.

163
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:48,517
I can't call my clients,
they'll kill themselves!

164
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:51,490
-Great, now my chest hurts.
-What?

165
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,528
My chest hurts.

166
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:58,863
-And now I can't breathe.
-Are you having a heart attack?

167
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:02,599
If I were, would I have shooting
pains up and down my left arm?

168
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,673
-Yes.
-Then, yes. That is what I'm having.

169
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,640
Oh, my God!

170
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:16,648
Okay, this thing is useless.
So will you dial 911 for me?

171
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,589
Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.

172
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:25,022
Most people would be excited if they
didn't work for a couple weeks.

173
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:28,267
Most people don't like their jobs.
I love my job.

174
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:32,629
I've been not working for three hours,
and I'm already going crazy.

175
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,466
I miss Joan.

176
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:39,336
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's
way of telling you to slow down.

177
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:43,275
I always thought having a heart attack
was nature's way of telling you to die.

178
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,451
You're not gonna die.

179
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:50,986
I mean, you are going to die,
but you're not gonna die today.

180
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:52,450
I wish I was dead.

181
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:55,385
Let's take a walk.

182
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:59,394
You should consider writing for
<i>Talking Out of Your Ass</i> magazine.

183
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,592
What's going on with you?

184
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:09,973
Well, I've been doing a lot more
of my karate.

185
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:13,942
-Still a dry spell with Carol?
-Yeah.

186
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:16,581
How long has it been since
you've had sex?

187
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,942
-Well, last weekend...
-Oh, that's not so bad.

188
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,848
...will be two months...

189
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,984
...since I stopped trying.

190
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:28,987
You need to spice things up.

191
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:30,762
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

192
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:34,228
You could tie her up.
You could eat stuff off each other.

193
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:39,364
Dirty talk, <i>ménage à trois,</i> toys.

194
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,740
Role-playing.
You're the warden, she's the prisoner.

195
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,467
-You're the pirate, she's the wench.
-Okay, I think I got it.

196
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:50,580
Or you could be two stockbrokers, and
you're rolling naked on the trading floor...

197
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,808
...and everybody's watching.

198
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,216
It never happened.

199
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:05,787
Sorry.

200
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:10,663
-So how is it going with Joey?
-Just great. He beeps me now with codes.

201
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:12,566
One is: "Bring me food."

202
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:16,037
Two is:
"I'm with a girl. Bring us food."

203
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,440
Three is:
"I'm lost and I can't find food."

204
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,842
Oh, sweetie.

205
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,810
Is there any food around here?

206
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,117
-Is she gonna be all right?
-Yeah, she's in there.

207
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,778
Oh, great.

208
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,490
Go take off those pants.
They look ready.

209
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,000
And over there is Brady's Pub...

210
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:45,136
...where I like to unwind
after a long day of "surgeoning."

211
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,033
This is so amazing. What else?

212
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:51,367
Well, that is a large piece
of television equipment.

213
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:53,306
And that is an old man.

214
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:55,070
-Hey, old man!
-Hey.

215
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:58,579
Alrighty. What do you say we head
back to my place?

216
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:04,187
You know, I would really love to,
but I shouldn't.

217
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,824
Why?
Why can't the world stop turning...

218
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:13,030
...just for a moment, just for us?

219
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,324
Isn't that a line from the show?

220
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,702
Yeah, but...

221
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,842
...I may have said
those things before, but...

222
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:28,207
...I never truly meant them until now.

223
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,307
That's a line from the show too!

224
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:34,146
Okay, you watch too much TV.

225
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:37,856
Here's the freshly
squeezed orange juice you asked for.

226
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,024
Thanks.

227
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,384
There's pulp in that.

228
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:49,559
I thought we talked about this.
I don't like pulp.

229
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:52,396
No pulp. Pulp isn't juice.
All juice.

230
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,565
I'm sorry.
I guess I just like the pulp.

231
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,742
I'm sorry.
I am being so rude.

232
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,037
Rachel, would you like a soda
or something?

233
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:07,080
Because Chandler will
run right out and get it.

234
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:10,215
Yeah, well, sure,
iced tea would be great.

235
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:11,685
Iced tea.

236
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,251
Okay. Anything for you, sir?

237
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:19,964
Did I not just tell him?

238
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:24,397
Okay, look, Chandler,
if this is gonna work...

239
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:28,267
...you have got to listen.

240
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:33,204
You're gonna throw that juice at me,
aren't you?

241
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,641
It's not all juice.

242
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:43,483
So, honey, this morning was fun, huh?

243
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:47,487
Me hopping in on you
in the shower there?

244
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:51,388
Yeah, maybe someday we could get
a place with two bathrooms.

245
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:58,530
Look, Carol, I was thinking maybe....

246
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:01,637
Maybe we can spice things
up a little.

247
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:05,037
-What do you mean?
-Carol, our sex life. It's just not--

248
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,475
-Dad!
-Hey there, little fella!

249
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,040
Why don't we
get some shoes on you, huh?

250
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:14,310
Why don't you show Dad how you
can put your shoes on in your room.

251
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:20,785
Seriously, our sex life.

252
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,954
I was thinking maybe, I don't know...

253
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:27,130
...we could try some new
things, you know, for fun.

254
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:30,199
-Like what?
-Well, I don't know.

255
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:36,640
What if we were to...

256
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,601
...tie each other up?

257
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:51,713
Some people eat stuff
off one another.

258
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:55,019
Yeah.

259
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:58,992
You know, we could try dirty talk.

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,936
-We could have a threesome.
-I love that idea!

261
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,968
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?

262
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,042
Oh, my God, that's so great.

263
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,013
You're a published writer.
I wish I had a present for you.

264
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,106
Wait a minute.

265
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,479
My last Kit Kat bar.

266
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,424
-You want to share it?
-Okay!

267
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,895
Chandler, I know you're mad.
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:41,663
I was a total jerk.
Completely over the line.

269
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,865
I just.... I hate pulp.

270
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:47,939
You know how Monica feels
about low-fat mayonnaise?

271
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,239
It's not mayonnaise!

272
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,681
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, and here.

273
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:00,685
-What's this?
-Fresh-squeezed orange juice, with pulp.

274
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,327
-Just the way you like it.
-Thanks, man.

275
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,026
Hey, Joey.

276
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:13,234
Joey? Chandler sold a story
to Archie Comics.

277
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,636
That's great! Congratulations!
What's the story?

278
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:20,139
You wouldn't care.
It's just a stupid comic book story.

279
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:23,904
Are you kidding me?
I love Archie and the whole gang.

280
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:30,746
Well, Archie needs money
to fix his jalopy.

281
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:37,954
But he doesn't want Reggie
to just give him the money.

282
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:40,858
So Reggie hires him as his assist--

283
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:44,966
As his butler.

284
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,367
And then makes him do crazy things...

285
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:51,006
...like bring him milk shakes
that can't have lumps in them.

286
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:56,278
Wait a minute.
That sounds a little familiar.

287
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,818
Did they already do that one?
I think I read it!

288
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,759
Monica, listen. I have to ask.

289
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:12,259
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back
to his apartment.

290
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:17,265
-Does he do this with a lot of girls?
-Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.

291
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,465
And I'm one of them.

292
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:26,835
I just cannot believe this.
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.

293
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,707
You don't have to use his last name.

294
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:32,578
But, Monica, come on,
it's Joey Tribbiani.

295
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,076
I guess you have to.

296
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,755
It's none of my business,
but aren't you married?

297
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,252
Yeah.

298
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,720
I wish we could just not be married
for a little bit.

299
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,864
You know, I just wish we could be,
like, on a break.

300
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:53,769
Well, you're not.

301
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:57,534
It's easy for you. You're not married.
You can have sex with whoever you want.

302
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,302
Yeah, I can.

303
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,271
Don't think I don't. I do.

304
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:04,506
I mean, all the time. You bet!

305
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,285
Monica?

306
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:12,188
You've done it, right?

307
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:18,925
Of course I have. What do you think,
I'm, like, some 30-year-old virgin?

308
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:22,693
Oh, my God.
You're a 30-year-old virgin.

309
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,204
Say it louder. The guy
in the back didn't hear you.

310
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:29,165
Yeah, I heard it.

311
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:34,373
It's not like I haven't had the
opportunity.

312
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,673
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

313
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:39,710
I'm seeing this guy Roger.
He's not perfect...

314
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,386
...but I'm thinking maybe I should
get it over with.

315
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:44,419
You know, give him my flower.

316
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:52,091
Oh, my God, do it!
Honey, you've waited long enough.

317
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:56,962
-You know what? You are right.
-Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.

318
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:00,070
There shouldn't be all these
rules and restrictions.

319
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:03,366
People should be able to sleep
with whoever they want, whenever--

320
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:07,103
Rachel, I'm never gonna think it's
okay for you to cheat on your husband.

321
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,177
What do you know, virgin?

322
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:16,880
Phoebe?

323
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,081
Why is smoke coming out
of the bathroom?

324
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:24,057
The doctor said that could be
one of the side effects.

325
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:27,093
Put the cigarette out.

326
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:31,167
No, it's not a cigarette.
The smoke is coming out of me!

327
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,462
-Put it out.
-Okay, okay!

328
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:39,778
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Come on.

329
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,440
-I got it.
-Give it to me!

330
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,081
-I got it.
-Give it!

331
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:50,084
Hello?

332
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,654
She can't come to the phone now.

333
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,358
Right. No problem.
Okay, bye-bye.

334
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:59,187
Was it my work? Were they mad?
Was it Jack? Did he yell?

335
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:01,696
No, just relax. Nobody yelled.

336
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,494
Jack was making sure you
were getting better.

337
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,102
Thank God.

338
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,234
Yeah, she's fired.

339
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:14,674
<i>You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.</i>

340
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,971
<i>You've got to let her go.</i>

341
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,677
<i>Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.</i>

342
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:23,916
<i>Not so fast, Wesley.</i>

343
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:26,825
<i>Ramoray!</i>

344
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,526
<i>That's right, Wesley.</i>

345
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:34,492
<i>I just stopped by to say that</i>
<i>you're not a real doctor.</i>

346
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:37,793
<i>And that woman's brain is fine.</i>

347
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:39,698
Oh, thank God.

348
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,476
-<i>Hope? Hope?</i>
-<i>Drake.</i>

349
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:53,980
<i>You're not dying, Hope.</i>

350
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:58,187
<i>You're gonna live a long,</i>
<i>healthy life. With me.</i>

351
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,048
<i>Oh, Drake.</i>

352
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,125
Okay.

353
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,029
Here we go.

354
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:17,199
Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.

355
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:20,536
I am free tomorrow night.

356
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,177
Yeah, sure, sure,
I can bring some sandwiches.

357
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:33,249
So, honey...

358
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:36,624
...this threesome thing?

359
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,824
How are we even gonna start to find--?

360
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:43,796
Actually, I'm making a list of women
I know who might be into this.

361
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:54,034
Boy.

362
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:58,646
Someone's been
doing their homework.

363
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,280
I know Gail Rosten
is in there twice...

364
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,649
...but she is so....

365
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,756
Oh, I know.

366
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:11,662
You know, just talking about it
is getting me kind of....

367
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,660
I know. Me too.

368
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,633
I think Ben's asleep.

369
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:23,470
You know, I think it'll be
better if we just save it.

370
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:28,973
Right. Save it.
I can do that.

371
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:39,785
Why do you always wear
that dumb hat?

372
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,324
What, you late for your paper route?

373
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:44,996
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Jones.
Here's your paper.

374
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:47,325
I'm sorry about your window."

375
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,327
Hey, Pheebs.

376
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:54,694
How's it going?

377
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,501
I've got to get out of this bed.
I'm going crazy here! Crazy!

378
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,306
Here you go, sweetie.

379
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:03,606
What the hell is this, herbal tea?
I hate herbal tea.

380
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,884
Well, I put some honey in it.

381
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,918
-She doesn't know she was fired?
-No, the doctors say it may kill her.

382
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,286
What are you girls
whispering about over there?

383
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,721
But I think we should tell her.

384
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:24,600
Look, Pheebs, maybe this whole
heart-attack thing is a sign...

385
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,796
...that you should start thinking
about getting a different job.

386
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:29,964
Okay, what is this,
a stupid contest?

387
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,633
Because we've got a winner here.

388
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,338
He's right. People are not supposed
to have heart attacks at 31.

389
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:39,109
I know. But if I didn't work there,
what else would I do?

390
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:43,550
-You used to like playing the guitar.
-That was lucrative. Smart like your brother.

391
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:48,185
What about the massage thing?
That never gave you a heart attack.

392
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:50,653
Pulling in a salary
in the high six figures...

393
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:53,127
...or rubbing gross naked people
for chump change.

394
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,892
What do I do? What will I do?

395
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,867
I mean, it's just so realistic.

396
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,839
I know.

397
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,342
His name's Pat.

398
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:10,208
Pat the dog.

399
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:11,644
I get it!

400
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:20,684
Ready for a refill?

401
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:22,617
I probably shouldn't.

402
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,362
So I will!

403
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,901
-It's like it's raining.
-Pretty cool, huh?

404
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:35,335
But if you think you could put a fish
in there...

405
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:38,499
...and it wouldn't get sucked into
the mechanism, you'd be wrong.

406
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,241
Can I use your bathroom?

407
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:43,846
It's right through there.

408
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,650
You know, I gotta tell you.

409
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:50,754
If someone told me a week ago...

410
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:54,390
...that I would be peeing
in Joey Tribbiani's apartment....

411
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,116
Life's pretty great, isn't it?

412
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:07,034
I hope you're hungry.

413
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:09,297
We're starting with oysters.

414
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:12,672
You know what they say about oysters,
don't you?

415
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:14,877
They have parasites?

416
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:22,348
Some people say that oysters
are an aphrodisiac.

417
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:25,179
-What people?
-People.

418
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,153
People say it.

419
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:29,824
Come here.

420
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:34,324
So, oysters, huh?

421
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:38,798
Then we'll have a little
Middle Eastern couscous.

422
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:40,471
Something we can eat...

423
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,162
...with our hands.

424
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:45,103
When we were studying
communicable diseases--

425
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:47,302
No, no. No.

426
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:48,740
It's sensual.

427
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:51,109
Didn't know. Okay.

428
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,951
Sorry, it's the hospital.

429
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,581
The food looks great.
Save me some?

430
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,960
I can't promise anything.

431
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,661
We're really gonna do this?

432
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:16,565
Looks like it.

433
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:22,004
If this is too weird for you,
you can still back out anytime--

434
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:23,609
I got it!

435
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,721
-Thank you so much for coming.
-I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

436
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:37,159
I'm Ross, by the way.

437
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:38,418
Hello, Ross.

438
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:44,099
-I love what you've done with this space.
-Thank you so much.

439
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:49,267
How hot is this?!

440
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,741
I'm sorry you're here with me instead
of Roger.

441
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:58,973
Yeah, me too.

442
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,448
Well, I could make it seem like
he's here.

443
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:07,951
"Here's some little-known facts
about couscous:

444
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:11,627
They didn't add the second 'cous'
until 1979."

445
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,492
Stop it! That's not funny!

446
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,833
I'm sorry, okay?
It's just...

447
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:23,439
...tonight was supposed to be
a big deal.

448
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,437
-What was tonight?
-You don't want to know.

449
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:30,976
What was tonight?

450
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:36,746
Tonight was going to be
my first time.

451
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,183
With Roger?

452
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,521
Not just with Roger?

453
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:43,817
Oh, my God.

454
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:47,060
All right, relax,
Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!

455
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,666
Four different women!

456
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:54,328
I've had sex way more times.

457
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:57,540
-How many?
-Nine.

458
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,645
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

459
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:06,340
Good for you. You really think
that Roger's the perfect guy?

460
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:09,646
No, but he's not a horrible guy.

461
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:12,314
That's what I tell girls about me.

462
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,458
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!

463
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,389
No, you are not.
You are sweet and wonderful...

464
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,291
...and this is gonna happen for you.

465
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:23,297
Oh, really? When?
Do you want to do it with me?

466
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:24,958
Okay.

467
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:29,631
I was kidding.

468
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,074
So was I.

469
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,152
You're such an amazing actor.

470
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:47,923
How do you know where
Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...

471
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:50,659
...and Joey Tribbiani begins?

472
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:53,761
Well, with Dr. Drake...

473
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,990
...they always tell me what to say.

474
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:03,565
And with Joey, I pretty much have to
make it up on my own.

475
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:07,436
Tell me something, Joey.

476
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:14,147
-I just fell right off the couch there.
-Yeah, you did.

477
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,948
Here you go.
Let me ask you a question.

478
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,089
When was the last time...

479
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,691
...someone told you
just how beautiful you are?

480
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:27,222
Wow.

481
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,766
I can't feel my hands.

482
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:33,097
Come on. Come here.

483
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:05,101
We can't do this.

484
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:08,672
Oyster?

485
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:14,510
If we did do this,
there'd be a lot of pressure on me.

486
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:18,909
Because you've waited a long time,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

487
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,142
But I have nothing to compare it to.

488
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,844
Even if you were horrible,
how would I know?

489
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,290
I do like that.

490
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,759
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.

491
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,864
Well, if it helps,
there were only three.

492
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,693
So it'd just be for tonight, right?

493
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:40,268
Absolutely. It would just be one
friend helping out another friend.

494
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,869
Stop it. We're not doing this.

495
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,435
-Let's do it!
-No!

496
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:45,700
Okay!

497
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,506
Do you have any moves?

498
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,747
I have some moves.

499
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,120
I have no moves.

500
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,821
Okay, what you doing there?

501
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:07,493
-I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
-Yeah, forget it.

502
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,401
What if I turn out the lights?

503
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,680
That's the couch.

504
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:29,579
I know.

505
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:36,984
Oh, my God!

506
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,729
I know!

507
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,531
I'll tell you something.

508
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,166
We are gonna do that again!

509
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:00,845
Morning.

510
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:03,476
Oh, right.

511
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,050
Oh, God.

512
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:11,953
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
heard me throw up.

513
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,464
He actually saw you a little bit too.

514
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,631
Oh, God, we didn't...?

515
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:24,702
Not after seeing that.

516
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,877
God, I'm just a horrible person.

517
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,941
-Wh--? Why?
-Because I'm married.

518
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:33,980
That's right, I'm a married woman.

519
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:37,313
I came to a TV star's apartment
to have an affair.

520
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,385
That's ridiculous.

521
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:42,556
I'm not a "star."

522
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:46,492
I'm just a regular famous actor.

523
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:51,329
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.

524
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:53,900
Rachel, will you stop saying that?

525
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,630
Hey, look.

526
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:59,840
Remember on the show
when Capri was dying?

527
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:02,510
-And she gave me--
-The ring from the cave.

528
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:13,219
Oh, my God!
They let you keep that stuff?

529
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:17,187
Sure. As long as they don't find out,
you can keep whatever you want.

530
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:19,761
And I want you to have it.

531
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:21,621
No, I couldn't.

532
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,594
Every time you look at it...

533
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:27,294
...I want you to remember
that you are a good person.

534
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,598
Now, you had the chance to cheat...

535
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:32,340
...and with me.

536
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:37,942
But you didn't.
And that's what this ring stands for.

537
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,948
But I thought that ring stood for
Capri's undying love for her brother.

538
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:43,916
Look, you want the ring or not?

539
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:52,291
Hey, look at you! You're up!

540
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:54,454
I thought I'd try to take a walk.

541
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,691
Will you pour me some water?
I'll be back soon.

542
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:59,563
You're not gonna use
the pay phone to call work, are you?

543
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:01,736
No. I've learned my lesson.

544
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,175
Let's go! Come on!
Move it!

545
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,247
Phoebe, come on!

546
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:14,111
Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou.
Good luck with the gallbladder.

547
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:21,852
Hey, Joe...

548
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:24,522
...did you ever have a threesome?

549
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,465
Look, Ross, I think Carol's great,
and I'm sure you're very attractive, but....

550
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,902
No. The reason I'm asking is that...

551
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:41,635
...I sort of had one last night.

552
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,336
You?

553
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,417
All right. So? Was it amazing?

554
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:48,984
It was...

555
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,648
...okay.

556
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,520
Just okay? Did you do it right?

557
00:36:55,493 --> 00:37:00,055
Look, it's just, did you ever
go to a party and think:

558
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:03,995
"Would anyone really miss me
if I weren't here?"

559
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:09,095
But still, Ross...

560
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:14,503
...your worst day with two women,
pretty much better than any other day.

561
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:21,976
It's just...

562
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,817
...my part seemed to be over
pretty quickly...

563
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:28,592
...and then there was
a lot of waiting around.

564
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:32,997
But you got to be with both of them.

565
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:36,029
Not really.

566
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,333
Just Carol.

567
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:42,529
-Not the other one?
-No, she kept kicking me away.

568
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:44,807
You don't want that.

569
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:48,603
At least you got to
see a lot of stuff.

570
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:51,748
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.

571
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,076
-You get a little bored?
-A little.

572
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,245
Made a snack.

573
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,156
-What'd you have?
-Just a sandwich.

574
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:06,863
Turkey. A little mustard.

575
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:09,065
-Sounds good.
-It really was.

576
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:19,636
Let me tell you about this chick
I scored with last night.

577
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:22,373
Wait a minute, that was you.

578
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:26,173
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!

579
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,315
So you want to do something tonight?

580
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,888
I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over again.

581
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,022
Oh, right.

582
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:41,663
Because you're still seeing him,
and he's a good guy.

583
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,060
I remember a time....

584
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,425
Are you okay?

585
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:47,932
Yeah, totally.

586
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:49,595
Totally. Are you?

587
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:51,603
Great. It's so amazing.

588
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,108
Last time Dr. Roger came over,
I was so nervous.

589
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:59,306
But after being with you,
I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"

590
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,415
I bet he can.

591
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,055
"I don't have an appointment,
but I sure could use a physical."

592
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:13,152
-You sure you're okay?
-Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

593
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:26,600
My God! Barry!

594
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,473
You said you were going to
be away all weekend!

595
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:33,341
That's right! I'm sorry!
I am early!

596
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:35,610
Finish, please!

597
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:44,261
Surprise! Look who's back!

598
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:48,429
Call security.

599
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:51,428
Pheebs, didn't you get fired?

600
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,201
I don't think so.

601
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,935
-What are you doing here?
-All better. Back to work.

602
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:02,237
This clown from research
told me I was fired.

603
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,506
He should do his research, huh?

604
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,550
Well, you were fired.

605
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:13,356
I told that guy
who answered your phone.

606
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:16,189
I didn't get that message.
So this doesn't count.

607
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,019
Anyway, I'll be in my office.

608
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:20,895
Phoebe, you don't have an office.

609
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:23,360
I'll work right here.

610
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:26,002
This is good. Next to this plant.

611
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:29,899
You're in my office.

612
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:35,545
I've made a lot of cash for this
company. I am talking big bucks!

613
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,247
Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
You make one little mistake--

614
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,418
You lost 13 million dollars.

615
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,587
So now this is all about money?

616
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:46,852
You know, it's bad enough that....

617
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,449
You have got to be kidding.

618
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:53,424
-Are you all right?
-I'm having another heart attack.

619
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:56,132
I'm having another heart attack!

620
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,165
Call 911 !

621
00:40:58,903 --> 00:40:59,892
Dumb-ass!

622
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:04,465
Pheebs, how's it going?

623
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:07,075
They fired me, and I'm having
a heart attack.

624
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:08,905
Well, welcome back.

625
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:16,078
Is Joey Tribbiani here?

626
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:21,517
If you see him, please tell him
I'm looking for him...

627
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:25,058
...and that this time
I am not gonna throw up!

628
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:29,666
Well, that's always good news.

629
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,368
Are you okay?

630
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:33,092
Me? I'm great!

631
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:36,034
I'm fine! I'm so good!

632
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,806
But you know who's not great?

633
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:40,170
Men!

634
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,843
You're a man, right, Ross?

635
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,377
Sit down.

636
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,947
Let me ask you something.

637
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:51,387
Do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?

638
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:56,126
Why is it that the second
we tell you we are going out of town...

639
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:59,730
...bam, there you are in bed
with the neighbor's dog-walker?

640
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,995
We're sorry.

641
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:10,930
No, seriously. Seriously. What has
happened to the sanctity of marriage?

642
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:16,045
-Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
-What are you, a detective?

643
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:21,245
I don't know what's going on
with you and your husband...

644
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:24,478
...and what is hopefully
an adult dog-walker.

645
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,757
Look, can I just say,
not all men are like that.

646
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:33,360
There are men who'll do anything
to make their marriage work.

647
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:36,158
Men who will stand by and watch...

648
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,928
...as their wives engage in what can
only be described as a "twosome" ...

649
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:44,572
...with some woman she barely knows
from the gym!

650
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,775
Who are these men?

651
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:50,342
Just men. A guy I know.

652
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:54,411
Well, you might want to tell him
it sounds like his wife...

653
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,186
...is gay.

654
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:58,219
She is not....

655
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:05,192
She's gay.

656
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:09,532
Oh, my God.

657
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:13,565
She is so gay!

658
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,434
I can't believe this.

659
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:22,705
Good day for married people, huh?

660
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:27,342
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.

661
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:30,085
I'm sorry your wife is gay.

662
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,250
I guess women aren't that great either.

663
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:36,219
Try telling my wife that.

664
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,267
Okay to come in?

665
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:45,696
Come in, eat, whatever you want.

666
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,894
Dr. Roger got beeped again.

667
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:50,665
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him.

668
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:55,308
I'm the ruptured spleen.

669
00:43:57,615 --> 00:43:58,809
Why would you do that?

670
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:01,177
Because you shouldn't be with him.

671
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,245
You should be with me.

672
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:09,593
Really?

673
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:13,388
When you were talking about Roger,
that was killing me.

674
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:16,099
Things like last night,
they don't just happen.

675
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,336
At least not to me. I mean,
with the other two women...

676
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,406
...in the morning, I couldn't wait
to go hang out with my friends.

677
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,305
But with you...

678
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:33,844
...I was, you know,
already with a friend.

679
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,448
You probably don't want
to go out with me.

680
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:42,456
I make too many jokes, I've never
been in a serious relationship...

681
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,059
...and I'm not technically a "doctor."

682
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,566
There was just one woman,
wasn't there?

683
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:57,964
No, there were two.

684
00:44:58,209 --> 00:44:59,676
-Including me?
-Oh, yeah.

685
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:10,186
<i>It only takes two heart attacks</i>
<i>To finally make you see</i>

686
00:45:10,388 --> 00:45:14,518
<i>One of them won't do it</i>
<i>But the second will set you free</i>

687
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:22,729
<i>Tell all your hate and anger</i>
<i>It's time to say goodbye</i>

688
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:25,163
<i>And that is just what I will do</i>

689
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:28,303
<i>Soon as those bastards I worked for</i>
<i>Die</i>
