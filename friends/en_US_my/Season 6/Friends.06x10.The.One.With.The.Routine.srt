1
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:07,083
Why is everybody using
these tiny, little lights nowadays?

2
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:09,379
I remember when people used big ones.

3
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,080
That's a good story, Grandpa.

4
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:19,921
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

5
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,463
Did someone get her
drunk again, or...?

6
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:27,231
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

7
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,371
It's about being with loved ones.

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,100
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

9
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:37,410
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

10
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:39,981
Oh, here.

11
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:45,052
See, now it feels like Christmas.

12
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:49,018
The One With The Routine

13
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,932
And that's the story of the dreidel.

14
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:32,970
Some people trace the Christmas tree
to the Egyptians...

15
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:37,872
...who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...

16
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:40,669
...symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

17
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:43,848
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

18
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:47,780
Around the same time
that you started this story.

19
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:53,317
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey. What's up?

20
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:57,859
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over.

21
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:00,133
Everywhere I look she's like....

22
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:06,931
I can see why that's hard to resist.

23
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,442
I like her so much.

24
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,473
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

25
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,440
I know. And she's so sweet.

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,343
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

27
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:21,013
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

28
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,626
I am so over Janine.

29
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:32,331
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

30
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,331
-Hey, guys.
-Janine!

31
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,998
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

32
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:45,167
It's called some sort of
<i>Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.</i>

33
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:49,513
Hold it.

34
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:53,508
Are you talking about
<i>Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve</i>?

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,585
Yeah, that's what I said.

36
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,991
Oh, my God, we love that show!

37
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:04,162
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

38
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:07,832
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

39
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:12,564
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

40
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:17,605
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

41
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:21,445
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

42
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:24,377
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

43
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:27,416
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why--

44
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,086
Well, how it works is...

45
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:33,089
...the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

46
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:36,385
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

47
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:38,995
Not a lot of people know that.

48
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,128
Do you guys want to come too?

49
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:45,997
-Are you serious?
-We are there!

50
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:51,168
What are you laughing at?

51
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:55,346
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

52
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,845
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

53
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,952
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

54
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:05,548
Bye, Janine.

55
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,552
Did she just ask me out on a date?

56
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,460
I don't think so.

57
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:16,099
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

58
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,896
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

59
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:22,302
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

60
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,444
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

61
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,408
It's a New Year's Eve party.

62
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:32,084
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

63
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:35,118
If she says, "What are you doing?"

64
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:38,119
I can say, "It wasn't me,
it was New Year's."

65
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,855
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school...

66
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,690
...and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

67
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,867
It was a dry day.

68
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,643
We are going to <i>Dick Clark's</i>
<i>New Year's Rockin' Eve</i>!

69
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,710
Oh, my God!

70
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,905
Oh, my God!

71
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,111
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,483
Okay, I've been on sets before...

73
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:16,455
...so let me give you some advice.

74
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:20,063
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

75
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:23,359
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

76
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,229
-Got it.
-Okay.

77
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,569
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

78
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,206
Everyone! Gather up!

79
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:34,205
-Excuse us!
-Excuse us!

80
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:38,010
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance...

81
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:41,345
...we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

82
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:45,251
Yeah, I have a question.
When is this gonna air?

83
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,251
Yeah. Now, you guys dance
over there...

84
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:52,258
...you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

85
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:53,727
Everyone else, spread out.

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,835
We'd rather not dance together
because we're brother and sister.

87
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,664
Yeah, it would seem kind of weird.

88
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:03,935
As weird as coming all the way down here
and then having to go home right now?

89
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,111
So when is it gonna air?

90
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,784
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

91
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,321
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

92
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,156
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

93
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,698
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

94
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,196
That's terrible.

95
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,061
No, we do it every year.

96
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,771
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

97
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,799
Yeah, we never find them.

98
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:40,911
She's always bested us,
that wily...minx.

99
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:43,739
We'll search here for an hour...

100
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,645
...and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

101
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,253
-You can't look for Monica's presents.
-We have to.

102
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:54,621
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

103
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,458
Well, then you should look with us.

104
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,166
Why?

105
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,926
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

106
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,398
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

107
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,607
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

108
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,404
What if she gets you
a great present...

109
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,772
...two mediums
and lots of little ones...

110
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:18,144
...and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

111
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,943
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

112
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,083
-lf I help, we can find them faster!
-Right!

113
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:28,783
We have a live one!

114
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,690
-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
-Yeah.

115
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,234
Who's it for?

116
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:41,133
"Dear losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

117
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:45,174
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

118
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:51,109
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

119
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,011
We are so gonna find them this year.

120
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:59,021
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

121
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,317
Yeah.

122
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:03,153
You don't go into the back
of my closet...

123
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,829
...and look under my gym bag
or anything?

124
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,025
-No. Never do that.
-No.

125
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,302
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

126
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,104
Okay, that did not just happen.

127
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,277
Here comes a camera.

128
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,548
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

129
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:44,328
Why do they keep doing that?

130
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,404
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

131
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,335
They've been taping them all day.

132
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,735
Right.

133
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,947
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

134
00:08:58,218 --> 00:08:59,742
We learned how to dance.

135
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:04,712
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

136
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:06,583
Yeah!

137
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:13,165
-Hey, you're a good dancer.
-Really?

138
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,560
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

139
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,497
-What do you mean?
-Like this.

140
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,037
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

141
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,445
You're dancing with her.

142
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,216
-We're together.
-Yeah, we came together.

143
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,451
I don't see it.

144
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:37,845
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall guy, raise your hand!

145
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:43,588
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her, and I think I have a shot.

146
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,956
Really, you think so? I don't.

147
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,774
I couldn't find anything--
Hey, wait!

148
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,109
Yeah, we found them.

149
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,376
They were in the guest-room closet.

150
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,713
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

151
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:15,618
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

152
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,299
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

153
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,766
Chandler, what is this very weird
metal A-Z thing?

154
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,236
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

155
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,673
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."

156
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,351
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

157
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:40,847
Yes, okay.

158
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,580
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved...

159
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:48,622
...you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

160
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,170
Hey, dancing girl?

161
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,714
Can I go to the bathroom?

162
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,885
Here we go. Yeah.

163
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:20,624
Looking good, Gellers!

164
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,293
We know!

165
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:28,625
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

166
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,596
-We should go dance by him.
-Okay.

167
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,608
Okay, everybody, hold!

168
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:45,178
Next on the platforms are....

169
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:51,951
You two! And....

170
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:55,851
-You two!
-Cool!

171
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:57,254
Excuse me, sir?

172
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,693
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

173
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,356
Monica!

174
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,591
Would it?

175
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,700
How about me?

176
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,942
Hey, tall guy!

177
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,311
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

178
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:25,284
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

179
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,994
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

180
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:34,162
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

181
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,029
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

182
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,998
I'm trying to win her over. l--

183
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:40,762
I don't think so.

184
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,837
You can dance with my partner.

185
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,134
She's real mellow.

186
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:49,973
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

187
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:52,684
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe I could....

188
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:56,216
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

189
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,850
All right. Hey.

190
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:02,418
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

191
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,364
Are you in second grade?

192
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:11,364
Hey, man, you're the one
who wet his pants.

193
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:20,200
Monica would not
hide the presents down here.

194
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:24,645
No, but she did. Look, there's
that old hippie I've always wanted.

195
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:29,354
If they are here,
Gunther knows about it.

196
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:34,186
And I could get it out of him.
He's had a huge crush on me.

197
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:37,692
That's not fair to play with his head,
though. You do it.

198
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:39,525
Okay.

199
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:42,998
Hey, Gunther.

200
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,430
Hi.

201
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:49,507
Getting to be that holiday time again, huh?

202
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:52,576
Yes, it's like a miracle.

203
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:57,842
I was thinking, since it's the time
of giving gifts...

204
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:01,453
...I was wondering, are there any
presents around here for me?

205
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:04,488
You know what I mean?

206
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:08,919
-I think I found them.
-That's the Toys for Tots collection bin.

207
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:14,065
-That's awfully convenient, don't you think?
-For the tots it is.

208
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,735
-Hey, you guys, guess what.
-Did you find them?

209
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,998
No, Gunther fainted.

210
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,407
Man, this sucks.

211
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:30,944
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous...

212
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,380
...then who's gonna be
the losers then?

213
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,919
I know what'll get us up
on a platform.

214
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,657
What?

215
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,292
The routine!

216
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,763
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

217
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:48,331
When the snippy guy
sees the routine...

218
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,035
...he'll want to build us
our own platform.

219
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:52,532
Was it that good?

220
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:56,866
We got honorable mention in the
brother/sister dance category!

221
00:14:57,176 --> 00:15:00,634
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

222
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:03,976
Okay, let's do it.

223
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:07,543
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

224
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:16,118
Five, six, seven, eight!

225
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:02,497
So do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

226
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:05,709
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

227
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,609
Get this. Dick will want
it for the <i>Bloopers</i> show.

228
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:16,349
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

229
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,716
When we start again,
it'll be the countdown...

230
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:22,027
...so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

231
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:23,554
Hey, guy!

232
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:25,831
You got three seconds to get away.

233
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,429
What's going on here?

234
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,860
Take a look at the guy's pants!

235
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:34,596
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

236
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:37,869
What's the matter with you? Go!

237
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:40,102
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

238
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,045
Can you believe this?

239
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:46,444
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

240
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:47,846
I know!

241
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,114
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

242
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,081
No.

243
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,860
Me too!

244
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:58,161
When the music starts...

245
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,457
...I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

246
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:08,337
Ross, we should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

247
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:13,037
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

248
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,407
-Ten.
-Nine, eight.

249
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:20,016
-Seven.
-<i>Okay, it all comes down to this.</i>

250
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:23,278
<i>Whatever happens, happens.</i>

251
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,586
<i>Destiny.</i>

252
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:28,860
--three, two, one!

253
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,890
-Cut!
-No!

254
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,827
Year!

255
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:37,729
Happy "No" Year!

256
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:42,968
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

257
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,249
What did that snippy guy say?

258
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,716
I think he's kicking out
anyone who's not dancing.

259
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,048
So just keep dancing.

260
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:10,762
Hey, look who I found.

261
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,401
Oh, hi, guys!

262
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,539
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

263
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,642
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

264
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:23,237
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

265
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:27,914
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

266
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,156
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

267
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,427
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

268
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:39,324
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

269
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,927
How about my "az"?

270
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:50,405
-Hey. This is hollow.
-What?

271
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:54,342
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

272
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,279
-Oh, the presents!
-Don't look directly at them!

273
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:02,276
What?

274
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:04,922
All right, no, we could look at them.

275
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,624
This one's for me!

276
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:09,090
This one's for Chandler. Here.

277
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:12,820
-And the big one's for me!
-Oh, let's open them!

278
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:17,262
-Wait a minute. We can't do this.
-Why?

279
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:20,835
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

280
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,771
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

281
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,001
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

282
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,544
We have to put these back.
This is not what Christmas is about.

283
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:34,008
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

284
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:40,187
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

285
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:44,189
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

286
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:47,955
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

287
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:52,034
So, please, please, can we just...?
Can we put them back?

288
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:55,438
-Will you get us better gifts?
-Fine.

289
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,208
Hey, guys.

290
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,904
You found the presents?

291
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:05,349
You let them find the presents?

292
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:06,642
Great.

293
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,687
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

294
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:15,253
-That's what you got me?
-Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

295
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,064
Home sweet home, huh?

296
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,930
Nice to get back to reality.

297
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:33,234
Plus, we know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

298
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,080
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

299
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:40,747
Anyway, good night.

300
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,281
-Joey?
-Yeah?

301
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,189
Three...

302
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:49,752
...two, one.

303
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:58,669
Happy New Year.

304
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,000
What was that for?

305
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:08,640
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss...

306
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:12,806
...I was really, really disappointed,
and I just....

307
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,310
I just really wanted to kiss you.

308
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:17,187
Really?

309
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:22,650
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

310
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,628
-In the moment.
-But only in the moment.

311
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,863
So do you want to kiss again?

312
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,799
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

313
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,232
Can you wait?

314
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,143
No.

315
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:42,207
Me neither.

316
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:48,184
Three, two....

317
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,718
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

318
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,890
Oh. Okay.

319
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:58,919
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

320
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:25,079
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium...

321
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:28,020
...and the guy yells, "Cut!"

322
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,957
-So Joey didn't get to kiss Janine?
-Nope, he sure didn't.

323
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,660
I guess that means
that you guys are still tied.

324
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:41,897
I don't know about that.
I think she saw us do our routine.

325
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:45,737
I may have boogied right into first place.

326
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:50,213
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did...

327
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,976
...the routine from eighth grade?

328
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:56,747
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

329
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:59,958
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

330
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:03,751
There's no way you could've
done the end...

331
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,395
...the way you guys did it back then.

332
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,858
What? We could do it.

333
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:16,073
I don't know. You were a lot bigger--
I mean, stronger back then.

334
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,671
I can do it, okay?

335
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,411
Come on, let's go! Come on.

336
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,377
One, two, three, four...

337
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,177
...five, six, seven, eight.

338
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,910
I can't do it!

339
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,385
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
