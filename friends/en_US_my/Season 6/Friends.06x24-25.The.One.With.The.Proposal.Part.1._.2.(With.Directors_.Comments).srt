1
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:07,152
God, that is the most beautiful
engagement ring ever!

2
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:10,846
You should know.
You bought, like, a billion of them.

3
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:13,350
You didn't get one.

4
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:18,361
-Tonight's the big night.
-How you gonna ask her?

5
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:21,591
We're gonna go to her
favorite restaurant.

6
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:26,865
I'm gonna get her favorite champagne.
She'll know how expensive it is.

7
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:33,705
When the glasses are full, instead of
proposing a toast, I'm gonna propose.

8
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:36,379
It sounds perfect!

9
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:41,253
-You'll mess it up. Let me do it.
-I won't mess it up.

10
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,481
-lf she says no, can I have the ring?
-She won't say no.

11
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:47,225
lf.

12
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:50,893
-Sure.
-What about me? I want it too.

13
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,491
-She won't say no.
-I'll let you borrow it.

14
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,196
Hey, Monica.

15
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,009
-Give it.
-It's gone.

16
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:08,971
Phoebe.

17
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,384
Hey, Monica!

18
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,456
We're practically kissing.

19
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:23,259
The One With the Proposal

20
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:03,029
Anyone free tonight? My boss is
hosting a charity event for kids.

21
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:07,366
The more people I bring,
the better I look. Monica? Chandler?

22
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,601
We can't go.
We're going to dinner. Remember?

23
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:14,372
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
-What's the big deal?

24
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:19,448
I get mad when Rachel doesn't
remember where we're going.

25
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:22,750
Where are you going?

26
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:26,482
-How about you guys?
-Open bar?

27
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,196
-I think so.
-I can do that for the kids.

28
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:35,564
I'll come. I'm making money.
It's time I give some back.

29
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,465
You could give back
the money you owe me.

30
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,703
Okay. Have a benefit.

31
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:47,613
Ross, can you go
to a charity event tonight?

32
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:49,748
I have plans with Elizabeth.

33
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,010
You're already doing
your part for the kids.

34
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:59,485
It's our last night before she
leaves for camp. To be a counselor.

35
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:06,063
I have a question. All jokes aside,
where is this relationship going?

36
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,360
All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.

37
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:14,137
-Do you see this as long-term?
-I don't know.

38
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:17,674
-You are 12 years older than her.
-Who's counting?

39
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,312
Well, she is. She's this many.

40
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,542
Ross, she is really young.

41
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,447
Does everyone feel this way?

42
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,752
-Yeah, sort of.
-Sorry.

43
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:34,927
I thought you were just making jokes.
I had no idea.

44
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:39,723
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is
a chronological age difference.

45
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,630
But I never notice it,
because she is very mature.

46
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:48,570
It doesn't matter what you guys think.
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.

47
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,107
Not what she said last night.

48
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,114
See, now, he could date her.

49
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:01,548
Will you marry me?

50
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:04,553
Will you marry me?

51
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,588
Hey, you marry me.

52
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:18,869
-What's going on, little elves?
-It's the big night. We wish you luck.

53
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:21,336
-You have the ring?
-In my pocket.

54
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,307
-Pheebs.
-Wha--?

55
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:34,853
Will you guys get out of here?
This is a surprise.

56
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,648
Yeah, you guys. Get out of here.

57
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,250
Hey, guys.

58
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,729
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

59
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,434
What's going on?

60
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,506
We're just really...

61
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,373
...excited about this charity event
we have to go to.

62
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,143
-Here.
-Thank you.

63
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:11,654
-So, what's going on here?
-Well, this is a silent auction.

64
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,349
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.

65
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,620
Then the highest bid gets it.

66
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:22,358
I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?

67
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,800
-Why?
-No, it's nice.

68
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:31,471
Nice to see you.
So glad you brought someone.

69
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,475
Someone? I brought people.

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,242
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.
He's the head of my department.

71
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:42,319
-And I also brought my friend Joey.
-Shrimp toast!

72
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:46,683
You know, I don't know where he is.

73
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,018
I hope you'll bid.

74
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:53,255
Actually, I was about to bid
on this lovely trip to Paris.

75
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,765
-Nice choice. Good luck.
-Thank you.

76
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,060
Okay.

77
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,672
Twenty dollars.

78
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:12,117
Shut the door! Shut the door!

79
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:16,014
-What's going on?
-Guys are throwing water balloons.

80
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:20,056
Call the cops. That's what I did
to kids in my building.

81
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,991
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.

82
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:29,664
I stopped by to see if you wanted
to see this play tonight.

83
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,167
It's excellent. The director is--

84
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:36,308
-Who drank all the kamikazes?
-Nobody. We put them in here!

85
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,701
You want some?

86
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:44,811
-Could I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah, sure.

87
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:47,384
So this play, what do you think?

88
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:50,420
-It's gotten great reviews--
-Attack!

89
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:56,117
-Put your balloons down!
-You put your balloons down!

90
00:06:56,362 --> 00:07:00,890
Everybody put their balloons down!

91
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:05,933
Now, this is a nice suit!

92
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,567
If you'll excuse us...

93
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:16,239
...I would like to speak
to Elizabeth alone for a moment.

94
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:21,887
Whoa, Liz. Your dad's a bummer.

95
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,583
Our next item is
the romantic trip to Paris.

96
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:33,458
It goes to Emil Alexander
with a high bid of $2300.

97
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,794
So close!

98
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,669
Guys, look. Got me some drinks.

99
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:44,841
-What are you doing?
-Open bar.

100
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,236
Well, now it's an empty bar.

101
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:53,212
You can't stand anyone else
enjoying themselves, can you?

102
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,410
Finally, our biggest item.

103
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:59,154
The 22-foot
Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.

104
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,954
The winning bid
was a whopping $20,000.

105
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:05,789
I won.

106
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,267
That was my guess.

107
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,671
-What? What? What?
-I guessed $20,000.

108
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:17,975
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess. You buy!

109
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,542
What?

110
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,048
I don't have $20,000.

111
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,118
Congratulations on your new boat,
Joey Tribbiani.

112
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,991
Joey, sit down.

113
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:36,490
Forget her. You enjoy this.

114
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,438
What are you doing?

115
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,774
"One nation...

116
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:03,315
...under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."

117
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,685
I remembered it.
The champagne is here.

118
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,390
-You okay?
-Yes. I'm good. Are you good?

119
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:13,031
Is everything--? Are you perfect?

120
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:14,927
Yeah. I'm okay.

121
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:18,433
Actually, I'm a bit cold.
Can I have your jacket?

122
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,703
No, you can't have my jacket.

123
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,840
Because then I would be cold.

124
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:29,409
If you thought you'd be cold,
you should've brought a jacket.

125
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:33,644
But, other than that, are you okay?

126
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:39,257
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

127
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,658
In fact, I've been fine
for a long time now and I think...

128
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:46,798
...the reason is you.

129
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,724
That's sweet.

130
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:56,505
Before I met you,
I had really little life.

131
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,478
-And I couldn't imagine growing old--
-Oh, my God.

132
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:04,309
-I know. But let me say it.
-Richard.

133
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,846
What? I'm Chandler.

134
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,679
Oh, that's Richard.

135
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,923
Maybe he won't see us. Richard!

136
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,267
Monica. Chandler.

137
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,063
I don't know why I did that.

138
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,473
-Good to see you.
-You too. You let your hair grow.

139
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:33,407
That's right. You always wanted me to.

140
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:37,572
-I see your mustache is back.
-Well, my nose got Ionely.

141
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,886
You don't have a mustache,
which is good.

142
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:46,084
Chandler. I make jokes
when I'm uncomfortable.

143
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,456
-Hi, I'm Lisa.
-Hi.

144
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:53,394
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.

145
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,160
Richard, no one's supposed
to know about us.

146
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,240
See? I did it again.

147
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:05,004
-Chandler, sit down.
-I'll sit down.

148
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:08,009
-Good to see you.
-Your table's ready, sir.

149
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:09,738
Good to see you guys.

150
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,544
If you prefer, this table's available.

151
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,249
That might be fun.

152
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:25,829
-What were you thinking?
-I didn't know it was an auction.

153
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:30,469
I figured I'd take a guess.
Help a charity. Free boat!

154
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:33,799
Why would a charity give away a boat?

155
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,976
I don't know. Charity?

156
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,402
Well, just buy the damn boat.

157
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,147
Don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

158
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,581
I'm just helping the kids.

159
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:50,314
How is you drinking helping the kids?

160
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:55,289
Because the more I drink, the less
there is for the kids to drink.

161
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,599
Mr. Tribbiani,
your contribution brings us...

162
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:04,861
...a step closer
to building the youth center.

163
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:09,007
-I'm so happy you brought him.
-So am I.

164
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,234
I'm curious.
How much is that boat worth?

165
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:16,973
-I think it was valued at 19,000.
-Hey, I was pretty close.

166
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,011
So, bad news.

167
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:26,350
I can't buy the boat.
I don't have any money.

168
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:33,762
Joey! Joey, good one. He's silly.

169
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,391
Good! Very good!

170
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:45,238
-So I think I'm gonna take off now.
-You can't leave, Joey!

171
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:48,505
You agreed to buy that boat.
It's a contract.

172
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:51,444
Plus, if you leave,
my boss will kill me.

173
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:54,514
I don't have that kind of money.

174
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,951
I know. Okay, okay.
This is what we'll do.

175
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:01,957
We'll let the next
highest bidder buy it.

176
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,459
Then you'll pay the difference.

177
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:08,760
Okay. I don't know why the kids
need a youth center anyway.

178
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:13,769
They should just watch TV after school
like I did. I turned out fine.

179
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,629
Not great.

180
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,078
I'm helping the kids so much
I think I'm gonna throw up.

181
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,044
So we're hiding in the bathroom....

182
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:30,711
I get out. But before she can,
her parents come in.

183
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:35,223
I hide in the shower.
They start going at it on the floor.

184
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:36,588
Oh, my God!

185
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:38,093
I got a good one.

186
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:42,633
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy.

187
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:53,842
It's so great seeing you guys again.
I'd like to make a toast.

188
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:57,573
As a poet once said,
"In the sweetness of friendship...

189
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:01,082
...let there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures.

190
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:06,122
In the dew of little things, the heart
finds its morning and is refreshed."

191
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,153
What?

192
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,661
Oh, my God! You guys!

193
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:23,899
Have we got a story for you.
Guess who we bumped into?

194
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,305
-Who?
-Richard!

195
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,642
Right, that's Richard's
favorite place too.

196
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:38,017
-Oh, you knew that? Good.
-Weren't you going out with Elizabeth?

197
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:42,091
I was. She was a little busy
with a water balloon fight.

198
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:46,231
Sometimes grownups have commitments
they can't get out of.

199
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,490
Maybe she is too young for me.

200
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,729
When I was over there,
I felt like I was a babysitter.

201
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,001
I see what you were talking about.
I don't know what to do.

202
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:01,874
Weigh the good stuff
about her against the bad.

203
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:06,142
That's what I did when I
first started...weighing stuff.

204
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:11,950
Okay, bad stuff.
I'm 12 years older than she is.

205
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:14,149
The school could fire you.

206
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,226
-She's leaving for three months.
-For camp.

207
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,627
Okay, good stuff.

208
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,925
Well, she's sweet and pretty and--

209
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:26,627
And the sex is probably great, huh?

210
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,768
It's tender and respectful,
if that's what you mean.

211
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,882
The only thing you need to ask is,
"Do you see a future?"

212
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:41,410
Do you see yourself marrying her?

213
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,919
My God. You married her, didn't you?

214
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:50,321
No, I didn't do that. It's just....

215
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,794
Okay, honestly, no.
I don't see a big future with her.

216
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,202
Okay, I think that's your answer.

217
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,301
I gotta talk to her. I hate this part.

218
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:05,138
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful...

219
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:08,507
...you may not get married
at all this year.

220
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:20,081
-Weren't you supposed to do something?
-Good luck with Elizabeth, my man.

221
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:36,806
My God, Phoebe, how many have you had?

222
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:40,070
1, 2, 3.... Seven times three--
21 !

223
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:46,110
-You must be just wasted!
-I'm a little tired.

224
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:51,153
-Next highest bidder is at table one.
-Great.

225
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,484
The guy with the Paris trip
is at table four.

226
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:59,130
-Why do you care about who won?
-It's a trip for two.

227
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,832
Excuse me.

228
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:10,004
Is the person who won
the Paris trip at this table?

229
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:12,940
-That was me.
-<i>Enchanté.</i>

230
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:21,142
-Is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
-That's me.

231
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,556
Well, hello. This is your
lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.

232
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,925
The Gentleman Daysailer
has become available again...

233
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:33,189
...and I believe you made
a bid of $ 18,000.

234
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,493
You have to pay that.
It's not just a guess.

235
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:44,007
I was relieved I didn't win.
My wife would've killed me.

236
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,770
You kidding? She'll love this boat!

237
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:49,243
-What is your wife's name?
-Pam.

238
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,883
Just imagine this: <i>The Pam.</i>

239
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,156
I don't think she'd like that.

240
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:03,419
Okay. Imagine this:
<i>The</i> M<i>r. Bowmont.</i>

241
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:07,857
-I don't think so.
-Let me paint you a little picture.

242
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:13,061
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your...arms.

243
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:19,141
You get all that peace and quiet
you've always wanted.

244
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:22,337
You get back to nature.
You can go fishing.

245
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:26,382
You get one of those hats.
People call you captain.

246
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:29,145
And then when you're old, Cappy.

247
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:35,120
-It's for a good cause. All right.
-No way! It's mine!

248
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:36,361
What?

249
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:43,161
-The stuff you said, I want that!
-But you don't have $20,000!

250
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:47,032
Who cares? I'll make payments!
I want the M<i>r. Bowmont</i>!

251
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,773
-Oh, my God. You're back.
-Let me see it. Let me see your hand.

252
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:59,883
Why do you wanna see my hand?

253
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:03,885
I wanna see what's in your hand.
I wanna see the trash.

254
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:09,555
It's all dirty.
You should throw this out.

255
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,158
-What did you just do?
-What happened?

256
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,770
-Richard was there. I couldn't do it.
-Oh, no.

257
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,806
I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.

258
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:26,273
-Now you've ruined it.
-We didn't.

259
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:30,142
Who walks in a room
and asks to see a person's hands?

260
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,918
A palm reader, a manicurist,
a hand doctor....

261
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,918
-Glove salesman.
-Good one!

262
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,457
This is terrible. What will I do?

263
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:47,030
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.

264
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,691
I'll pretend marriage
is the last thing on my mind.

265
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:55,465
Convince her you're scared
of commitment, that you're a coward.

266
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,609
I can do that.
I've had years of practice.

267
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:01,871
Being you is finally gonna pay off!

268
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:08,710
Some idiot keeps stuffing
the trash chute with pizza boxes.

269
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,879
That guy is still doing that?

270
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:16,286
Oh, my God. Let me see your hand!

271
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:20,056
You're too late!
She already took out the trash!

272
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,217
Look, Elizabeth, we have to talk.

273
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:53,493
<i>I have never had</i>
<i>such a healthy breakup.</i>

274
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:57,031
<i>She was such a grownup about it.</i>

275
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:00,896
<i>She didn't seem too immature for me.</i>

276
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:04,504
<i>Did I just make a huge mistake?</i>

277
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,233
Ross! Wait!

278
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,912
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about--

279
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:11,173
You suck!

280
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:13,407
What?

281
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,726
Breakup's still on.

282
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:38,098
Here she comes. Do I look like
I don't wanna get married?

283
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,575
And, also, a little like a French guy.

284
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:48,079
I never noticed that before.

285
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:56,122
-What are you up to?
-Hanging out. Talking about websites.

286
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:01,091
We saw this interesting website
about marriage...

287
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,363
...and how unnecessary it is, a way
for the government to keep tabs.

288
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,164
Yeah, Big Brother.

289
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:10,906
That's a bit crazy.

290
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,809
Although I am glad you're looking
at other things on the Internet.

291
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:20,944
Got me thinking.
Why would anybody want to get married?

292
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,817
To celebrate the relationship,
solidify the commitment...

293
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:28,322
...declare your love for one another
to the world.

294
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:33,531
Well, that's good to know.

295
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,466
The M<i>r. Bowmont</i> is here!

296
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:47,903
A diner wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?

297
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,571
Sure. I love this part.

298
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,518
-Come on in.
-Hi.

299
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:58,083
-Richard.
-I'm not here to compliment the chef.

300
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,951
I hate when people come back
to compliment the chef.

301
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,594
Like I have nothing better to do.

302
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:06,856
So, what's up?

303
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,899
It was great seeing you
the other night.

304
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:11,933
Good to see you too.

305
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:18,874
-You came to tell me that?
-I came to tell you something else.

306
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:24,243
I came here to tell you
I still love you.

307
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,150
What? What did you--? What?

308
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,851
I still love you.

309
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:36,528
I know I shouldn't even
be here telling you this.

310
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,162
You're with Chandler, who I like.

311
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:42,094
If you say he's straight,
I'll believe you.

312
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:47,334
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd regret it.

313
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,066
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

314
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:54,703
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

315
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,610
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place...

316
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,843
...but I had to tell you.

317
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:05,645
I wanna spend my life with you.
I wanna marry you.

318
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:08,955
I wanna have kids with you.

319
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:14,832
Oh, my God.
Why don't they put chairs back here?

320
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:19,459
Look, I know this is crazy,
but am I too late?

321
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:23,467
You're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

322
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,076
I know. I was an idiot.

323
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,746
I tried to forget you. I really did.

324
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:33,646
After our last lunch, I spent
six months in Africa trying to forget.

325
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:37,317
-What did you do there?
-Work with blind kids.

326
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:40,024
What are you doing to me?

327
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,049
Look, I....

328
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:45,555
I'm sorry,
but this is not gonna happen.

329
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:49,666
That's fine. I'll walk away.
I'll never bother you again.

330
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:54,271
Only if you say Chandler's willing
to give you everything I am.

331
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:56,873
Well, he is. I mean...

332
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:00,601
...marriage is all he talks about.
My goodness!

333
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,577
In fact, I'm the one making him wait.

334
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:05,578
You are? Why?

335
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,183
Why?

336
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,144
Because of the government.

337
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,550
Isn't it incredible?

338
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:19,821
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

339
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:23,024
I know. They'll be so happy together.

340
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:26,203
How often do two best friends
fall in love?

341
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,464
-Not that often.
-No.

342
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:33,607
-I'm so happy for them.
-Me too. So happy for them.

343
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,704
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

344
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:40,980
Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.

345
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:49,955
I'm probably 98% happy
and maybe 2% jealous.

346
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:53,427
-I mean, what's 2%? That's nothing.
-Totally.

347
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,568
-I'm like 90/10.
-Yeah. Me too.

348
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,005
Have you guys seen Chandler?

349
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:13,750
No. But you know
who was looking for you?

350
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:15,579
Tennille.

351
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:28,757
The marriage stuff you were saying
yesterday? You don't believe that.

352
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:34,270
Sure, I do. In fact, I think the
concept of marriage is unnatural.

353
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:38,534
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

354
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:40,541
Pigs don't mate for life.

355
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:44,375
A pig can have 100 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

356
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:48,747
That's an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

357
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,084
Yeah, but that's pigs, not people.

358
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:58,888
If marriage worked, I'd be for it.
Do you know the divorce rate?

359
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,621
Ninety-seven percent!

360
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,226
Wait a minute.

361
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:08,069
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

362
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:11,765
-Who's to say?
-You! You are to say!

363
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:14,605
Never say never, but, probably...

364
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:16,110
...yeah, never.

365
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:21,447
Oh, my God. Then what are we
even doing? What is this?

366
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:25,111
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is all this pressure?

367
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,490
Is this some new strategy?

368
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:31,891
Why don't you put down your copy
of <i>The Rules,</i> huh, mantrap?

369
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:34,923
You know what? I gotta go.

370
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:39,693
It's okay. I got a plan.

371
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:48,005
-We're gonna find love.
-Definitely.

372
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,176
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

373
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:57,213
That's what makes it so easy to be
80% happy for Monica and Chandler.

374
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:01,148
-A guarantee would be nice.
-What do you mean?

375
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,760
Some friends make a deal.

376
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:08,524
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

377
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:10,429
-A backup?
-Exactly.

378
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,364
Yeah, I've got that.

379
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:15,339
You do?

380
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,837
-Who?
-Joey.

381
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:21,844
-Joey? Are you serious?
-I locked him in years ago.

382
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:30,111
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

383
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,289
Yep. We shook on it.

384
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:36,718
But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

385
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:39,455
Oh, seriously?

386
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:41,962
I think his exact words were--

387
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:45,658
Charming.

388
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:48,506
He's just a backup.

389
00:28:56,748 --> 00:29:00,445
-Hey, Monica.
-Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

390
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,686
-It's for my boat. Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah, it's great.

391
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:08,415
What's wrong? Talk to the captain.

392
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:13,865
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.

393
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:17,968
-Chandler being difficult?
-I don't want marriage tomorrow.

394
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,630
But I wanna know we're going
somewhere, that I'm not wasting time.

395
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:25,868
-You know Chandler.
-No, I don't know Chandler.

396
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:30,310
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

397
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:34,049
-Maybe you changed.
-I didn't change.

398
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:36,215
Maybe that's the problem.

399
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:40,823
-What?
-Chandler is a complex fellow.

400
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,722
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

401
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:48,298
Is that some kind of boat talk?

402
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:52,464
I haven't totally decided
how to talk on my boat yet.

403
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:57,869
Does he think
I'll wait around for nothing?

404
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:01,239
Face it.
Chandler is against marriage.

405
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,311
And always will be.

406
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,450
There's some people
who do wanna marry me.

407
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,950
-There are?
-Yeah. Richard.

408
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,356
Richard said he wants to marry you?

409
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:17,859
-And Chandler says he hates marriage?
-That's right.

410
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:19,928
Chandler loves marriage!

411
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,330
You just said he hates marriage!

412
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:28,097
"He's a complex fellow
who's unlikely to take a wife" !

413
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:31,434
"He's against marriage
and always will be" !

414
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:34,077
You got that from what I said?

415
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:43,412
<i>After the Cretaceous Period,</i>
<i>the dinosaurs were gone.</i>

416
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:46,488
What happened, you guys?

417
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,999
-Rach.
-Hey, you.

418
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,263
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

419
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:02,730
I'm so sorry
to hear about you and Elizabeth.

420
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:07,037
Thanks. I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.

421
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:09,406
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

422
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:14,017
Yeah. Love.
It's a tricky business, isn't it?

423
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,083
-I guess so.
-So, what do you say we make a pact?

424
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:22,760
If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

425
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:26,191
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other...

426
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,425
...we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises.

427
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:32,364
No, like, "What's that?"

428
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:39,937
-Oh, you want me to be your backup.
-Exactly.

429
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,272
Yeah. I already have one.

430
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:45,105
-What? Who?
-Phoebe.

431
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:46,841
Phoebe?

432
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:50,219
But she just said Joey is her backup.

433
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,582
Oh, I don't think so.

434
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:57,284
We just spoke. She said
that she and Joey made a deal.

435
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:01,966
That's impossible. We have had
a deal for years. We shook on it.

436
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:06,297
Although, believe me,
she wanted to do a lot more than that.

437
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:11,342
Gunther, it's Joey. Is Chandler there?

438
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,946
Listen. What kind of muffins
do they serve at sea?

439
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,748
Where the hell have you been?!

440
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:24,581
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.

441
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:28,954
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.

442
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:32,756
-What?
-I've been trying to find you.

443
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:37,526
And I would have if these damn
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

444
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,227
-Oh, my God!
-I know! They suck!

445
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:43,703
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!

446
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,205
-I know!
-What--?

447
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,506
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!

448
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:51,079
Will you help me?

449
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:57,982
Look, I don't think us getting
our asses kicked is a solution, okay?

450
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:01,659
-Look, just go and find Monica.
-You're right.

451
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,158
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring...

452
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:07,456
...I'm gonna go find her
and I'm gonna propose!

453
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:10,457
Dude! Dude! Dude!

454
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:14,002
That coconut phone
might be good for the boat.

455
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:29,848
Hi.

456
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:33,686
Hi.

457
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,259
I don't know why I'm here.

458
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:40,489
I didn't ask.

459
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:46,166
-You wanna come in?
-I don't know.

460
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:48,667
Oh, okay.

461
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:52,970
I'll just leave the door open
and sit on the couch.

462
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:58,313
-Chandler is such an idiot!
-Drink?

463
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:02,553
-Scotch on the--
-Rocks with a twist?

464
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,278
I remember.

465
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:09,251
You still smoking cigars?

466
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:12,629
No, no. That's art.

467
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,358
If it bothers you,
I can put my art out.

468
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:20,071
No, that's okay.

469
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,069
So, Monica, let me ask you a question.

470
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:29,212
Since we broke up, do you ever...

471
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,041
...think about me?

472
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,876
Actually, I thought about you
a few months ago.

473
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,044
-Really?
-But it's because...

474
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:40,952
...I had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

475
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:43,719
-Who is it?
-Edward Nevsky.

476
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:45,392
He's no good.

477
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:50,628
Do you ever think about me...

478
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:54,563
-...in a non-eye-doctor way?
-No.

479
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:03,041
Because getting over you was
the hardest thing I've ever done.

480
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:06,382
I never let myself think about you.

481
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:08,476
<i>Wow.</i>

482
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,426
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

483
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:20,462
-You can't have two backups!
-Of course I can.

484
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:23,532
It's good sense
to back up your backup.

485
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,363
-Look, I've already lost Chandler.
-What?

486
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:30,036
Hey, Phoebe! We're both your backup?

487
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,937
How could you do this to me?

488
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:37,848
Why are you complaining?
You were both aware of the situation.

489
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:39,950
-I was not!
-No, we weren't!

490
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:43,780
This kind of backtalk won't fly
when we're married.

491
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:47,022
You can't have both. Pick one.

492
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:48,715
-Pick me!
-No, pick me!

493
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,897
-I don't wanna end up an old maid.
-All right. Well, let's see.

494
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,464
Ross is a good father.

495
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:57,993
But...

496
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:00,535
...Joey has a boat. This is hard.

497
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:03,400
This is crazy.
I wanna switch to Rachel.

498
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:07,270
-I wanna switch to Rachel too.
-No, wait. Just wait.

499
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:10,608
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.

500
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:12,806
Just remember my promise:

501
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:16,043
If we get married, three times a week.

502
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,812
Oh, my God. Phoebe....

503
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:20,490
I'm talking about massages.

504
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:22,818
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

505
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:28,933
I know how to settle it.
We'll do this.

506
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,625
I'm gonna write "Joey"
on one napkin...

507
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:37,638
...and "Ross" on the other napkin
and we're gonna pick one.

508
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:40,640
That person will be our backup. Okay?

509
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,437
-Sounds fair.
-All right.

510
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,945
Good. Switching them up.

511
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:50,284
-Pick one.
-Left.

512
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,248
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

513
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:57,961
-Ross.
-Joey.

514
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:02,262
-We should switch.
-Absolutely.

515
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:09,538
I missed you,
you ugly flat-faced old freak.

516
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,268
Excuse me?

517
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:16,941
Him.

518
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:24,978
I missed this apartment.
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

519
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:27,657
I should be with a grownup, you know?

520
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:32,190
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.

521
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:34,991
Maybe someone with...

522
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,028
...a license to practice medicine.

523
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:40,132
Or a mustache.

524
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:44,101
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.

525
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:47,244
I need someone
who wants the same things.

526
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:51,905
Coming to my work and telling me
you love me, I want that!

527
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,250
Talking about pig sex over lunch,
I don't want that!

528
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:59,114
I think that's fair.

529
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:02,292
Please, don't even talk
to me about fair.

530
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:05,794
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.

531
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:08,465
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

532
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,829
Believe me, nothing
about this is fair. Nothing.

533
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:14,733
-Nothing! Nothing!
-It's okay.

534
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,609
Nothing.

535
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,744
I don't know.

536
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,578
I don't know.

537
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:31,685
I know.

538
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:37,625
I have to figure some--

539
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:40,491
Some stuff, before I can....

540
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:42,232
I understand.

541
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:45,766
Take as much time as you want.

542
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:49,302
Ten, even 20 minutes, if you need it.

543
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:53,005
I'll be here. Not smoking.

544
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,228
Where is she?

545
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:13,464
I'm not scared of you.

546
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:17,963
She's not here. And please come in.

547
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:20,670
Scotch on the rocks...

548
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:23,340
...with a twist, on a coaster.

549
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,099
Monica?

550
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,312
Okay, she was here. But she left.

551
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,879
Where did she go?

552
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,710
She said she had to think things over.

553
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:38,355
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.

554
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:40,285
Look, nothing happened.

555
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:44,484
Nothing? So you didn't tell
my girlfriend you love her?

556
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:47,490
Well, all right, one thing happened.

557
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:52,165
You know what you did?
My girlfriend is thinking things over.

558
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,964
You made my girlfriend think!

559
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,803
Well, I'm sorry.

560
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,809
-What's to think about? I love her.
-Well...

561
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:05,312
...I'm willing to offer her
things that you aren't.

562
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:09,008
I'm willing to offer her
those things. I had a plan...

563
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,590
...to throw her off so when I offered
all these things, she'd be surprised.

564
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:17,918
If it helps, it worked very well.

565
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:22,197
It was working till you showed up,
you big tree.

566
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,603
This isn't fair.

567
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:30,137
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!

568
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:35,278
This is my chance. I won't blow it,
because we are meant for each other.

569
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,779
And this has all just been
one stupid mistake!

570
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,648
I was gonna propose tonight.

571
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:48,217
-You were gonna propose?
-Yeah, I even...

572
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:52,592
...got a ring. Did you get a ring?

573
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:54,458
No, I don't have a ring.

574
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:02,196
You go get her, Chandler.

575
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:07,302
And can I give you a piece of advice?

576
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,377
If you do get her...

577
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:12,109
...don't let her go.

578
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,750
Trust me.

579
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:20,179
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.

580
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,686
I know.

581
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:26,486
I hate that.

582
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:43,606
-I've gotta find Monica.
-She's gone.

583
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:47,417
-What?
-She had a bag and she left.

584
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:49,586
-What?
-She was all crying....

585
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:53,120
She said you guys
want different things.

586
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:57,589
-Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?
-I told her everything.

587
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:02,061
-But she wouldn't believe me.
-Well, where--? Where did she go?

588
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:07,568
To her parents' . She said you shouldn't
call. But if I were you, I would.

589
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:12,337
-I can't believe I ruined this.
-I am so sorry, man.

590
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:26,045
You wanted it to be a surprise.

591
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,490
Oh, my God.

592
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,531
Chandler...

593
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:48,846
...in all my life...

594
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,242
...I never thought
I would be so lucky...

595
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,415
...as to fall in love with my best....

596
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:02,348
My best....

597
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:06,396
There's a reason why
girls don't do this!

598
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,891
I'll do it. I thought....

599
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:15,965
Wait, I can do this.

600
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,937
I thought that it mattered...

601
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:26,742
...what I said or where I said it.

602
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,476
Then I realized...

603
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:32,755
...the only thing that matters
is that you....

604
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:41,030
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

605
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,068
And if you let me...

606
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:51,040
...I'll spend all my life trying
to make you feel the same way.

607
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:01,350
Monica...

608
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,811
...will you marry me?

609
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:08,548
Yes.

610
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,771
I knew you were likely to take a wife!

611
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:30,941
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

612
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,073
Come in! Come in!

613
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:37,017
We're engaged!

614
00:44:43,728 --> 00:44:46,663
This is the least jealous
I've ever been.

615
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:50,529
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!

616
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:56,597
Hell, he's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!
