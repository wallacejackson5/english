1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,516
Can you help me pick
an engagement ring?

2
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:10,814
I can't figure this out. Should I get her a
Tiffany cut or a princess cut or a--?

3
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,359
Paper cut!

4
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:18,788
-Have you told anyone else?
-No, I don't want Monica to find out.

5
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,090
You told me.

6
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,699
Because I trust you
and we're friends...

7
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:25,770
...and you saw me looking
at ring brochures.

8
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:29,205
Once again, not knocking pays off.

9
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:33,137
-I wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
-Me too.

10
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,948
Let me see. Is there such a thing
as a Monica cut?

11
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,415
Because that would be you best bet.

12
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:45,814
-Want to go to the coffeehouse?
-Oh, all right.

13
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,525
We were just gonna see
if you wanted to go.

14
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:52,198
Well, we don't because
we got the other place.

15
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:57,400
How rude.

16
00:00:58,038 --> 00:00:59,335
Sorry. Want a bite?

17
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,833
The One With The Ring

18
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,840
So how are things going with Paul?

19
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,106
Good.

20
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:45,874
Although, you know,
he's a private guy.

21
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:49,249
I wish I could get him to open up,
share some feelings.

22
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:54,085
You just have to think of him
as a jar of pickles that won't open.

23
00:01:56,029 --> 00:02:00,022
I should run him under hot water
and bang his head against a table?

24
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,835
That's what you do when you want
to get the truth out of someone.

25
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,875
-Watch this.
-Okay.

26
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:13,636
-Hey, Paul.
-Hi, Phoebe.

27
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:15,643
How are things going with you?

28
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:19,045
Can't complain.

29
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,449
-Hey!
-Hi.

30
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,524
-Great to--
-Ross, good to see you too.

31
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,321
You take care.

32
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:40,239
What was the deal with you
and Chandler blowing us off before?

33
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,270
That was so weird, huh?

34
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:45,003
Why did you do it?

35
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:48,679
I didn't do it. It was Chandler.

36
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:51,173
He's mad at you.

37
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:55,345
-What? Why?
-Oh, please. I think you know why.

38
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:57,948
I can't think of anything.

39
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:01,820
Come on. You're a paleontologist.
Dig a little deeper.

40
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,864
Is it because Joey and I didn't
invite him to that Knicks game?

41
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:12,430
Is that something
he'd be mad at you for?

42
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:16,371
-I guess it could.
-Well, then I think that's it.

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,713
If he's angry, he shouldn't hide it.
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.

44
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:27,010
You should run him under hot water
and bang his head against the table.

45
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,991
Honey, I made a reservation
at China Garden. Is that okay?

46
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:34,523
Yeah, that's great.

47
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:38,890
But first, talk to me.
Talk to me. Tell me about your day.

48
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,133
It was fine.

49
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:43,736
Okay.

50
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,205
What are you thinking right now?

51
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:52,036
That you are looking
really fine in that dress.

52
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,408
Yeah, that's great, Paul.
But, you know....

53
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,250
I want to know what--
Wow, those are really great!

54
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:03,519
I just want to know...

55
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,886
...what is behind this strong,
silent exterior?

56
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:13,030
They say that still waters run deep,
and I want to swim in yours.

57
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,793
Are you talking about having sex?

58
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,005
No, Paul.

59
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:24,905
I don't know anything about you.
Tell me about your childhood.

60
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,406
Normal.

61
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:31,206
Then how about puberty? Come on!
That's always a painful time.

62
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,217
Your friends have a slumber party
and stick your hand in warm water...

63
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,288
...while you sleep, so you pee
in your sleeping bag.

64
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,392
No, that never happened to me.

65
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:46,658
You're lucky you never
met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.

66
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:48,668
Anyway....

67
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,500
The rest of your life. Any regrets?

68
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:54,633
Nope.

69
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,567
I'm not asking for a lot here.

70
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:00,905
Just give me something. Anything.

71
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,745
-Okay.
-Okay.

72
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:10,421
When I was 6 years old,
I wanted a Big Wheel.

73
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,554
And instead, my parents
got me this little...

74
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:17,889
...plastic chicken
that you hop around on.

75
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,430
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.

76
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,429
That was a tough year.

77
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,102
That's great! See?

78
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,638
I already feel like I know you
a little better.

79
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,573
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat. Let's go!

80
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:36,474
It was horrible.

81
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,948
They called me "Chicken Boy."

82
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,791
In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, not really.

83
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,728
Richard Danville bit me.

84
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,493
I still have a little scar right here.
You can see it.

85
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,966
Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.

86
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:06,111
I think this is really great that,
you know, you've shared your feelings.

87
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,211
It's really....
It's beautiful.

88
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:11,748
But what do you say we
go share some food?

89
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:13,612
No, I couldn't eat now.

90
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:17,619
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken!

91
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,283
Chicken?

92
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:27,397
-Chicken Boy!
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

93
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:39,140
This is the nine millionth ring store,
and I can't find the perfect ring.

94
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,780
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring....

95
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,643
It's a beautiful selection.

96
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:54,084
So maybe you don't get her a ring.
Maybe you do something different.

97
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,557
An engagement bracelet
or an engagement tiara!

98
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,630
An engagement Revolutionary War musket!

99
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:06,997
I'm so glad I picked you
to help me with this.

100
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,207
Imagine getting down on one knee...

101
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,775
...and handing her this gorgeous
piece of weaponry?

102
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,711
I'll stick with the ring.

103
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,112
This one's nice. I like it. Sir?

104
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,846
Kind sir, can I see this one?

105
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,853
This is why you brought me.
I know how to haggle.

106
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:30,426
-Let me handle this from here.
-Can I help you?

107
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,097
-I would like to see that ring.
-Or not. Whatever.

108
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,263
This ring is from the 1920s.

109
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:40,836
It's a one and a half carat diamond
with sapphires.

110
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:42,701
Sir, could I ask you...?

111
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,141
Could you hold out that ring
and ask me to marry you?

112
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,609
-Okay.
-Okay.

113
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:53,884
Will you marry me?

114
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:57,286
Oh, my God, that's it!
That's the ring!

115
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,122
-How much is it?
-I will handle this.

116
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,052
How much is it?

117
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,320
$8600.

118
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,896
We will give you $ 10.

119
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,764
-Are you interested in this ring?
-Yes.

120
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:14,063
But I can only pay $8000.

121
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:18,703
-Okay. I can let it go for 8.
-We stand firm at $ 10.

122
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,710
-How would you like to pay?
-Credit card.

123
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,473
Oh, no! I lent my credit card
to Joey.

124
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,878
I'll go get it.
You guard the ring.

125
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,453
-Why did you give your credit card to Joey?
-To buy some Knicks tickets.

126
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:34,389
Then the jerk didn't even invite me
to the game. But I'm over it. Whatever!

127
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,096
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

128
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,698
Do you have anything here for $ 10?

129
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,995
Yes. I have these two
rather beautiful...

130
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:48,706
...five-dollar bills.

131
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:53,074
I'll give you $ 1 for them.

132
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:58,879
Remember how Chandler
and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?

133
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:00,413
No.

134
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:05,124
-Remember, you were eating pizza?
-Yeah.

135
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:11,523
Chandler's angry at us for not getting
him a ticket to that Knicks game.

136
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:17,028
We were supposed to just get him one?
That guy's always mooching off of us.

137
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:22,674
Anyway, I still think we should
try to patch things up.

138
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:26,072
We could get tickets to another
game and invite him.

139
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:30,373
That's a great idea.
And I still have his credit card.

140
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,942
Here you go.

141
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:35,246
Hey, hey. I got this one.
Here you go.

142
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,917
Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.

143
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:43,720
We do stuff all the time without you,
and you don't get all upset.

144
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,767
-All the time?
-All the time.

145
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm sorry, it was rejected.

146
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:55,234
That's impossible. Let me see that.

147
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,199
This one's mine. Here you go.

148
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,611
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

149
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,707
-Still crying?
-Like a little girl.

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,080
I know, I know. This is all my fault.

151
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,086
I wanted him to open up.

152
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,885
I didn't know that
I was gonna unleash...

153
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:19,121
...this weepy, clingy,
moist monster!

154
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:24,100
I only know of two ways to shut
a man up. One of them is sex.

155
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:27,663
-What's the other?
-Don't know. Never had to use it.

156
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,437
I'm just saying, if we're having sex,
he's not talking.

157
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,874
That's right. You're the talker.

158
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,343
Anyway, great idea.

159
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,812
I gotta buy him some more tissues.

160
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,285
-We have some here.
-No, you don't!

161
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:53,621
Okay. I'd also like
to try on the tiara.

162
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,159
Oh, yeah. Okay.

163
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,472
What do you think? Too much?

164
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:04,799
A tad.

165
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,576
Take the tiara back...

166
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:11,482
...and let me hold the musket again.

167
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:21,683
Something's missing.

168
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:25,162
Let me see the ring that
my friend picked out.

169
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:31,065
-Where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?
-I just sold it to that gentleman.

170
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,998
Oh, my God!

171
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,866
Wait, no!

172
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:41,541
Let me out! Now!

173
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,254
Rachel?

174
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,821
No.

175
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,592
-How are you, Paul?
-Okay.

176
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:06,802
Chandler...

177
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:11,941
-...did your dad ever hug you?
-No. Did he hug you?

178
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,971
No! No.

179
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:18,376
It's just that my dad never did.

180
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,277
I miss my dad.

181
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,747
You can see my dad in Vegas
kissing other dads.

182
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,256
-Hey, Chandler?
-Yeah?

183
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,031
Would you...?

184
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:40,432
Would you hug me?

185
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:46,302
-I'm a little busy here, Paul.
-That's what my dad used to say.

186
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,879
Okay. A quick one.
Come on, hug it out.

187
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,417
There you go.

188
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,112
Okay.

189
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:58,615
-Five more seconds--
-Okay!

190
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,724
-Joey!
-What? Hey, what--?

191
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,557
Hi. Paul, is it?

192
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,499
-Do you have my credit card?
-Yeah. It's in my....

193
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,365
In my pocket.

194
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,806
-My back pocket!
-Thank God.

195
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:25,015
-I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
-I can't go.

196
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:26,377
It'll be fun.

197
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:31,113
Me, you, Ross and
Paul, probably.

198
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,421
Look, I don't have time for this, okay?
I gotta go.

199
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,263
That was mean.

200
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,193
Yeah, I know.

201
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,436
-Get in here.
-Yeah.

202
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,044
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.

203
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:58,112
I'm gonna go with
the one I picked first.

204
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:02,117
Oh, wake up. The one
you picked is gone. It's over!

205
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:03,777
What?

206
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:08,487
Some guy bought it. I tried to stop
him, but they put me in jail!

207
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:13,697
-They put you in jail?
-The little jail between the doors!

208
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,128
-I asked you to guard the ring!
-I know. I'm sorry.

209
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:21,337
But this ring is better. And Monica
never saw the other ring.

210
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:26,067
Yeah, but when he proposed to me
with the ring, I got goosebumps.

211
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:29,279
-Maybe it was the guy.
-It was the ring!

212
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:36,144
-Was he excited about the tickets?
-No! He blew us off!

213
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:38,413
-What?
-I know.

214
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,487
I can't believe it.

215
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,790
Can I tell you something?

216
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,487
I'm a little mad at him now!

217
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,864
Can I tell you something?

218
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:51,970
Me too!

219
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,274
He didn't want to talk to us
about being angry.

220
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,001
Maybe we don't talk to him at all!

221
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:04,147
-Freeze him out.
-Right!

222
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,850
-I like it.
-We'll show him.

223
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:10,111
From now on, it's gonna be
Joey and Ross, best friends.

224
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,288
We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.

225
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,620
What?

226
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:21,724
You think you and Chandler
were closer than me and Chandler?

227
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,925
Hey, don't get angry.

228
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:27,128
We turn on each other, he wins.

229
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,345
Hi, I'm back.

230
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:36,504
I've written down more to tell you!

231
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,579
Oh, that's great.

232
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,947
No, actually, that's....

233
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:45,749
That's great. That's really great.

234
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:50,395
You know, I gotta tell you, writing,
all that writing, it gets me....

235
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,427
It gets me kind of hot.

236
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,133
Wait, wait. Listen to this:

237
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,866
Know what I wanted to be at that age?

238
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,533
A lover?

239
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:03,937
-A surfer.
-A surfer?

240
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,775
-I wanted to be one with the waves--
-Hold on.

241
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:12,417
Let me just get
a little more comfortable here.

242
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:13,676
Wait a second.

243
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:17,013
-This isn't too revealing, is it?
-No.

244
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:20,792
Whatever happened to that little dude?

245
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:23,587
So full of dreams.

246
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:29,427
I don't care about the little dude!

247
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:32,904
I can't! I cannot listen
to any more of this!

248
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,539
The only one who'd listen
is a mental health professional!

249
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,073
That's only because
they get $ 100 an hour!

250
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:43,338
Do you know how much money I could
have made listening to you? $2000!

251
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:46,551
Know when I figured that out?
While you were talking!

252
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,650
I can't believe you're trying
to stifle me when 14 hours ago...

253
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:55,383
...we figured out that's what
my mother was trying to do!

254
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:58,252
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:02,194
I don't mean....
I didn't mean to stifle you.

256
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,704
This is all just
a little overwhelming.

257
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:10,074
I'm so sorry.

258
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,671
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.

259
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,743
It's just that
when those gates open...

260
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:19,880
...it's hard to close them.

261
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,886
But they are closed now. Believe me.

262
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:28,854
I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.

263
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,990
And I'm glad that you're done.

264
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,797
So what do you say we....

265
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:40,266
I'd like that.

266
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:55,576
That was so good!

267
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:06,364
Oh, oh.

268
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:13,868
I can't believe you talked me into
this gumball-machine-Iooking ring.

269
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:17,868
It's not a gumball-machine-Iooking ring.
It's a beautiful ring!

270
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,567
No, it's not.

271
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:23,407
When I looked at the other ring,
I could see Monica's face...

272
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:27,450
...and I could see her saying yes.
Looking at this, I only see a ring.

273
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:32,056
Unless I look at it really closely,
and then I can see my own eye.

274
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:41,823
This is the most important thing I'll
ever do. I want to make it perfect.

275
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,631
Maybe we could get
the other ring back.

276
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,601
I heard where
the guy was gonna propose.

277
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:52,607
-Maybe we could get him to trade rings.
-I can't do that.

278
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:56,304
You certainly can't give her
that stupid gumball ring.

279
00:18:56,515 --> 00:19:00,508
-All right. Where was he going?
-Yeah, it's a restaurant....

280
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,911
-The Rainbow something.
-Rainbow Room?

281
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:04,478
Rainbow Grill?

282
00:19:04,657 --> 00:19:06,648
Somewhere Over the...?

283
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,754
-L'Espace.
-Rainbow L'Espace!

284
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,920
No, just L'Espace.

285
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,898
I'd love to know how you got
from rainbow to L'Espace.

286
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:18,798
No, you wouldn't.

287
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,163
You don't wanna get in here.

288
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:31,548
There he is.

289
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,515
He hasn't proposed yet.
She has no ring on.

290
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:38,655
Wow, you're good!
After this, we should solve crimes.

291
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,150
Okay. Go get him.

292
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:41,918
Oh, okay.

293
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,564
Excuse me. Could you
come with me? You have a phone call.

294
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,303
-Who is it?
-It's your office.

295
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:53,935
-Do you know who at my office?
-John.

296
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,164
Oh, John! Great!

297
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,809
-There he is.
-Hi. Okay.

298
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,014
There was a mix-up at the store.

299
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,581
The ring you have was supposed
to be held for me.

300
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm gonna need to have that back.

301
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,757
In exchange, I'm willing to trade you
this beautiful, more expensive ring.

302
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,793
Wow, I would trade.

303
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,803
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use
this one. Excuse me.

304
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,437
This is my fiancée,
and her heart was set on that ring.

305
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,369
Do you want to break her heart?

306
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:34,073
Yeah. Do you want to break
a dying woman's heart?

307
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:36,447
You're dying?

308
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,543
Yeah, she's dying...

309
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,981
...of a cough, apparently.

310
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:49,988
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
If I'm not buried with it...

311
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:53,323
...my spirit will wander
the netherworld--

312
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:54,692
That's enough!

313
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,097
Oh, I don't know.

314
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,869
-Let me see it.
-Great. Okay, here.

315
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:07,939
-All right, I'll do it.
-Thank you.

316
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,343
And you are about to marry
a wonderful man.

317
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,550
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman!

318
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:27,387
Guys?

319
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,870
I've got something important
to tell you.

320
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:35,869
Guys?

321
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:38,569
Guys?

322
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,244
Guys?

323
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:44,413
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

324
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:49,220
I think we gotta end the freeze-out.

325
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:53,388
Wait. Is this for real?

326
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,457
Yeah. Check out the ring.

327
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,388
Oh, my God!

328
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,723
So you two are really serious?

329
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,433
Yeah, pretty much.

330
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,766
You're gonna get married?

331
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:12,538
We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Come here!

332
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:16,576
And we're gonna be friends again.

333
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:20,046
What?

334
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:23,153
-Water under the bridge! Forget it!
-Okay.

335
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:27,550
I was gonna wait till it was official,
but I had to tell you guys.

336
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:29,556
You're my best friends.

337
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,218
-I can't believe this.
-Me too.

338
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,890
I was planning on having a conversation
with you about your intentions.

339
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,936
I think I'm gonna cry.

340
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,334
Oh! No more crying!

341
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:44,542
I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.

342
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:49,012
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

343
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:51,109
Oh, my God!

344
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:53,010
Oh, my God!

345
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:56,449
Oh, Chandler!
You guys are gonna be so happy!

346
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:59,850
-I know.
-Where's all the tissues?!

347
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:07,221
-Check out the ring.
-Oh, nice. One and a half carat, easy.

348
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,160
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

349
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:14,098
-He's gonna ask Monica to marry him.
-I helped pick out the ring.

350
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:20,510
You told her before you told us?

351
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,113
She walked in while I was looking at
brochures. You can understand that.

352
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,219
Guys?

353
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,355
Guys?

354
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,062
God, that ring Chandler picked out
was so beautiful.

355
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:47,204
You should know.
You've bought like a billion of them.

356
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:52,404
Humor based on my pain.

357
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,137
You know what's funny?

358
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:59,614
Of all of your wives,
I'm the only one who never got a ring.

359
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,185
This a big issue for you?

360
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:06,152
No, but it would have been nice
to have a little memento...

361
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:08,987
...of our married time together.

362
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:12,255
Something other than the divorce papers
and the hangover.

363
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,491
Ross is obviously
not gonna get you a ring.

364
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,694
But ask for a musket.
Ask for a musket!

365
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:24,134
When we were married,
do you know what I never got?

366
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:25,435
Sex.

367
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,613
Well, yeah. No ring, no sex.
Big surprise.

368
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:34,309
Get me a musket and we'll talk.
