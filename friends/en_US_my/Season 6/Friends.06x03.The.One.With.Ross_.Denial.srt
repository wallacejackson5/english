1
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:07,343
Check it out, this is unbelievable!

2
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:10,714
Joey's been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:17,924
You trying to kill me?

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,964
-I want to ask you something.
-What?

5
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:25,593
Since I'm moving out,
and you're so beautiful...

6
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,072
...how about I move in with you?

7
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:31,505
That would be great,
but what do we do about Denise?

8
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:34,676
-Who's Denise?
-My roommate.

9
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:35,837
Your roommate?

10
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,074
Yes, Denise. Denise!

11
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,252
What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?

12
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,490
What about Denise? She cute?

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,428
How can you have a roommate
that we don't know about?

14
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,960
Because you never listen
to what I say.

15
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:53,291
I talk about her all the time.
Denise!

16
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:58,798
I'm gonna have an extra room
over at my place.

17
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,167
-That's true.
-Move in with me.

18
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,435
We can stay up late talking,
and watch movies.

19
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,839
You know about
naked Thursdays, right?

20
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,817
Yeah, yeah. I think
I'll find my own place.

21
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:16,052
Hey! I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

22
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,757
The One With Ross' Denial

23
00:01:58,198 --> 00:02:00,962
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

24
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:02,326
Oh, that.

25
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,630
She took it really well.

26
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:07,602
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No.

27
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,075
Because you're in love with her.

28
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:14,509
I am not in love with her. She was
upset about having to move out.

29
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:17,615
If she knew we were still married,
she'd have been more upset.

30
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,148
So I comforted her.
As a friend.

31
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:21,887
You "comforted her"?

32
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,782
Nothing.
I just gave her a hug.

33
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,790
A classic sign of love,
the hug.

34
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,461
It's also a sign of friendship.

35
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,597
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson."

36
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,163
It was a hug. Okay?

37
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:36,825
A simple hug.

38
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:40,939
I was a friend being a friend
to a friend.

39
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:43,234
Use the word "friend" more.

40
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:46,307
Did you, or did you not,
smell her hair?

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,741
Smell her hair?

42
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,713
What if I did?

43
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,876
Ninety percent of a woman's
pheromones come out of her head.

44
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:56,850
That's why women are shorter.

45
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,726
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

46
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,828
Come on, Ross,
you're a scientist.

47
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:07,424
I was hugging her as a friend.

48
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,998
It's not my fault
her hair got in my face.

49
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:13,104
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all...all...

50
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:15,765
...coconutty.

51
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,942
What? It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

52
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:23,775
Maybe it means
I have feelings for coconuts.

53
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:29,115
Okay, but be careful. Rachel's not
in the same place you are.

54
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,253
If the place you're
referring to is being in love...

55
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:37,155
...she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

56
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,056
I didn't understand that.

57
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:45,162
Maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

58
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,243
-A guy just called for you.
-Who was it?

59
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:56,641
I don't know. How about
"Thanks for taking the message"?

60
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:01,319
When you move in...

61
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:04,989
...Rachel's room will be empty.
Let's talk about what to do with it.

62
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,154
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room...

63
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:12,627
...with a mahogany sleigh bed and
bedside tables with fresh flowers.

64
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:17,198
And comment cards so people could
tell us how great their stay was.

65
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:21,633
I really haven't
thought about it that much.

66
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:25,272
Well, I like that idea...obviously.

67
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:29,240
I was thinking maybe...
maybe it could be a game room.

68
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:33,915
You can buy old arcade games, like
Space Invaders and Asteroids...

69
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:37,156
...for $200. The real ones.
The big, big, big ones!

70
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,181
No.

71
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:44,453
You mean "No" as in:

72
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:48,766
"What an interesting idea. Let's
discuss it before we reject it."

73
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:51,127
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,739
Interesting idea. But no.

75
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,533
So that's it?

76
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:02,407
I just don't think arcade games
go in a beautiful guest room...

77
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,809
...filled with antiques.

78
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:08,554
Which is why Asteroids is
perfect. It's the oldest game.

79
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:12,382
What's wrong with
a beautiful guest room?

80
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,594
I'm not against it.

81
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:18,627
Especially since everybody we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

82
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,128
Are you mocking me?

83
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:23,859
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

84
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,270
Monica and I
had a stupid fight.

85
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:36,913
You're still moving in together,
right? My ad came out today.

86
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:41,443
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

87
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,788
Nice.

88
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,589
I figured it'd be more interesting
to have a female roommate.

89
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,459
Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

90
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,297
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not 19...

91
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,973
...than a girl who is 19?

92
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,938
Not just a hatrack, my friend.

93
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:08,944
Pheebs, I have to ask you--

94
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,707
I'm swamped right now.

95
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:14,282
You're just staring into space.

96
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:17,283
I'm trying to move that pencil.

97
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,356
-This one?
-It worked!

98
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:25,828
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

99
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:29,832
Anything I can afford comes with
a roommate who is a freak. Look.

100
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,500
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

101
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:42,248
That's probably some 12-year-old kid
trying to get girls to call.

102
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,552
There's nothing. This city is full.

103
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,778
Wait! Look at this!

104
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:52,184
"Two bedroom, two bath. Must be
nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay."

105
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,557
Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.

106
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:03,302
-Rach, you still looking for a place?
-Yeah, why?

107
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:07,967
This guy, Warren, from the museum
is going on a dig for two years.

108
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:12,611
He's got this great place he needs
to sublet. You interested?

109
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:16,270
Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.
I love Warren!

110
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,850
Oh, wait. Is he the guy that asked you
for naked pictures of me?

111
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,255
That doesn't matter,
he won't be there!

112
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:25,687
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.

113
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:29,522
Thank the volcano that erupted
thousands of years ago...

114
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:33,689
...killing, but perfectly preserving,
an entire civilization.

115
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,867
Here's Warren's number.

116
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:42,374
This is great. I'm gonna
call him right now! Thank you!

117
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,606
Okay, you go call him.

118
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,074
I saw it.

119
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,882
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,089
I'm talking about what you already
know but won't admit.

121
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,757
You love her again. You re-Iove her.

122
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,621
I do not re-Iove her.

123
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,492
I can't believe
you won't just admit it.

124
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,263
Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

125
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:13,405
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?

126
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,671
The apartment
is already subletted.

127
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:19,835
It's hopeless.
I'll never find anything.

128
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,669
Live with me.

129
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,004
-What?
-What?!

130
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,183
What?

131
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,418
Are you serious?

132
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,284
I would love to live with you.
That's great. Thank you.

133
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,925
I'm just glad I could help you out.

134
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:43,327
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.

135
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,597
Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

136
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:52,904
I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me. You're my hero.

137
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,973
Hero? I don't know.
Well, all right.

138
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:02,280
I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

139
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,555
Oh, please.

140
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:14,294
You're gonna say things now,
aren't you?

141
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,732
No. No, I won't.

142
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,238
But I should tell you this.

143
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,403
The same thing happened to my
roommate, Denise.

144
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,839
She moved in with a guy
who was secretly married to her.

145
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,842
He said he didn't love her, but he
really did. And it just blew up.

146
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,778
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

147
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,444
Okay, that's a lie.

148
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,992
-You don't have a roommate.
-Denise!

149
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:45,554
No one ever listens to me!

150
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,001
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need a game room.

151
00:09:56,175 --> 00:10:00,544
I only played those games because I
couldn't get girls. Now I can get--

152
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:03,575
Now I have you.

153
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,379
No, not that I think I have you...

154
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:11,986
...or think of you as property
in any sort of way. I see women....

155
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,715
Stop it, Chandler.

156
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:16,354
I'm sorry too.

157
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:19,693
-Really?
-Yeah. Oh, yes.

158
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,934
We can think of something
to do with the room together.

159
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,970
Great idea. We can easily think of
a way for us both to enjoy the room.

160
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:30,640
Totally.

161
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:38,382
-We don't have to decide now.
-Good.

162
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:42,086
Let's think about changes
we can make in the living room.

163
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:43,589
Changes?

164
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:48,316
We'll have to move some
furniture to make room for my chair.

165
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:53,061
You're bringing the Barcalounger
over here?

166
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,758
Is that a problem?

167
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:59,831
It's just that they're a set
and should stay together.

168
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,200
That's cool.
I'll bring them both over.

169
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,801
You're taking them away
from their home.

170
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,609
I get it. I get nothing. Nothing
here is mine. Everything is yours.

171
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:14,341
I'll get up in the morning, put on
your clothes and go off to work!

172
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:19,224
Yeah, that's it. Everything will be mine.
Nothing will be yours.

173
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,589
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

174
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,022
It doesn't match.
Where will it go?

175
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:25,924
In the game room!

176
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:29,431
It is not my fault your
chairs are incredibly ugly.

177
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:31,102
That's fine.

178
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:33,602
I won't bring the chairs.
I won't bring anything!

179
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:37,264
I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance
over here at grandma's place!

180
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:41,776
Everything on your application
looks really good.

181
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,744
Just one last question.

182
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,181
Will your friends be over here,
partying and hanging out?

183
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,387
Don't worry.
I'm not a party girl.

184
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,858
Don't just be blurting stuff out.

185
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,995
I want you to really think
about your answers.

186
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:03,161
Call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

187
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,829
Ignore him. He's just some
guy who wants the apartment.

188
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,201
But he's not going to get it.

189
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:12,174
You took down the shower curtain?

190
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,141
That thing was a hazard!

191
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:16,948
I'm very safety conscious.

192
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:29,920
I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

193
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,163
Thanks.

194
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:36,266
But listen, Monica and Chandler had a
big fight and they're not moving in.

195
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:40,495
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

196
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:45,236
No, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

197
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,913
Over a stupid room?

198
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:52,718
I feel kind of bad for them, but now
I don't have to move in here!

199
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,611
Oh, no. Yeah, that part's great.

200
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,448
What's all this
about you guys fighting?

201
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:04,054
Is this really over a room?

202
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,661
That is so silly.

203
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,161
-We can handle this.
-Apparently not.

204
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,501
And I can't stand by and watch
two people I care about so much...

205
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,906
...be hurt by something
that is so silly.

206
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:25,183
Enough of the silliness.

207
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:26,942
Tell her to stop being silly.

208
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,120
Two very good points.

209
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,822
I've known you both a long time.

210
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:43,660
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy...

211
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,165
...as you've been
since you got together.

212
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,903
Do you really want
to throw that all away over a room?

213
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,270
That is so silly.

214
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,743
What's more important, love...

215
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,077
...or silliness?

216
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,919
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

217
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:06,057
But we also have a soft spot
for the love.

218
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,453
-Love is the best medicine.
-That's "laughter."

219
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:10,959
-Why do you do it?
-I don't know.

220
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:20,606
Now, Chandler, you want
to live with Monica, right?

221
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,069
Yeah, I do.

222
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,675
And, Mon, you want
to live with Chandler?

223
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:26,967
Yes.

224
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:30,340
A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York!

225
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:43,291
So I understand you're
looking for a place?

226
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:46,956
No, I'm staying put.

227
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:53,134
I was going to offer you
my apartment.

228
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:55,800
Why? Where you going?

229
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:58,474
I don't know.

230
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:04,978
You won't believe it.

231
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,175
Monica and Chandler
are moving in again.

232
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:10,354
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

233
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,059
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

234
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,498
Yeah. You know, about that....

235
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:25,233
I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything...

236
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:28,132
...but don't you think
it'll be weird?

237
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:33,539
Why? Why would it....
Why would it be weird?

238
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:37,009
Well, you know,
because of us.

239
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,150
Because of our history.

240
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,210
No!

241
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,484
No, no!

242
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:47,159
It would only be weird
if we were still in "that place."

243
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,623
Are you still in that place?

244
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,427
-No, not at all.
-Good. Me neither.

245
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,368
So it's not a problem.

246
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:59,697
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

247
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:03,308
Okay, but eventually
you and I will be dating.

248
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:08,203
Really? We are?

249
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:11,882
Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend
and you'll have a girlfriend.

250
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:16,550
That'd be great.

251
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:20,859
But if you think it'll be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

252
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:24,688
It'll be like in college.
I'll hang a sign on the door:

253
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:27,627
"Come back later.
I'm getting lucky."

254
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,473
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

255
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,471
So are you sure about
this whole moving-in thing?

256
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:46,378
It's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

257
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,021
That's very funny.

258
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:56,022
He's being silly because
he knows we enjoy the silliness.

259
00:16:57,263 --> 00:17:01,597
No, I'm serious.
Think about it. You move in.

260
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:06,602
You start fighting over game rooms.
Next thing you know, you break up.

261
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,874
It was just a stupid fight
about a room.

262
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:11,871
There are no stupid fights!

263
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,406
This isn't about the room.

264
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,981
This is about
what the room represents.

265
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:23,316
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you!

266
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,281
-I'm not so worried.
-Me neither.

267
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:29,356
Fine. It's your life!

268
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,787
I just don't want
to see you break up.

269
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:36,661
Which you will do
if you move in together.

270
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:42,140
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

271
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:43,808
Don't do it!

272
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:51,649
-You still want to move in together?
-Of course.

273
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,177
Ross didn't scare you?

274
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,614
Scared me out of wanting
to live with him.

275
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,654
-I gotta show you something.
-Okay.

276
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:05,623
Oh, my God!
Someone's killed Square Man!

277
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,531
The Barcalounger can go here.

278
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,500
You can see the TV, and it's still
walking distance to the kitchen.

279
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,503
Oh, that's so sweet.

280
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,804
I want to show you
something too.

281
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:21,501
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

282
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:26,779
I thought we could get one of those
signs and hang it over our bed.

283
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:31,318
Because that's you and I together.

284
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,050
"Merge!"

285
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,857
-I love that!
-Really?

286
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:38,018
"No!"

287
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:44,335
<i>I found you in my bed</i>

288
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,865
<i>How'd you wind up there?</i>

289
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:50,902
<i>You are a mystery</i>

290
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,601
<i>Little black curly hair</i>

291
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:59,744
<i>Little black, little black,</i>
<i>little black</i>

292
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,818
<i>Little black curly hair</i>

293
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:13,331
If you want to receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows...

294
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,535
...please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

295
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,931
Where are the other guys?

296
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,676
Well, Monica and Chandler
are occupied.

297
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,544
-Fighting?
-The other thing.

298
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,350
It's great they worked things out.

299
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,349
There's no breaking them up,
is there?

300
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,786
Can I borrow the key to your house
so I can go make a copy?

301
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,582
-Here.
-Thank you.

302
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:47,021
Are you sure? Once I make
a copy, there's no turning back.

303
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,194
Yeah, I'm sure. Now get out
of here before I change my mind.

304
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,807
You think moving in
with Rachel is a good idea?

305
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,447
I've been back and forth.

306
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,416
Well, maybe you should go back.

307
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,154
She moves in,
and before you know it...

308
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,549
...you're right where you don't
want to be, back together.

309
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:16,921
I don't think so. She's already
talking about dating other guys.

310
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:21,189
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy...

311
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,834
...and you'll be telling her, "Oh,
that's okay. You'll find someone."

312
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,436
And then, bam! She finds you!

313
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,170
Maybe you're right.

314
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:35,936
Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

315
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,307
Is that what you want?

316
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,450
Is that what I want?

317
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:40,845
Yes.

318
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,524
Here she comes. I'm gonna
make your life much easier.

319
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,785
The place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

320
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:51,156
Or not.

321
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,624
Why don't you move in with me?

322
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:56,765
Whoa, Joey!

323
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:02,974
Look, I know I scared you with
that whole naked-Thursdays thing...

324
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:07,078
...but we don't have to do that.

325
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:10,773
It would be easier
to move across the hall.

326
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:16,210
Unless you're thinking about
naked Wednesdays.

327
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,187
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!

328
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:29,390
Come on in.
Thanks for coming back.

329
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:32,264
There's a lot of people
interested in the room.

330
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,236
But I've narrowed it down,
and you're one of the finalists.

331
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:37,967
-Great!
-Before I decide...

332
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:41,169
...I want to be sure
our personalities match.

333
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:43,542
So I made up a little test.

334
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:47,049
I'll say a word, and you say
the first thing that comes to mind.

335
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,880
-I can do that.
-Okay, here we go.

336
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,556
-Pillow.
-Fight.

337
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:53,624
