1
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:06,542
Oh! Hey, Rach.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,381
I was just coming over here to....

3
00:00:10,857 --> 00:00:13,951
Wait, I don't have to Iie to you,
you don't Iive here anymore.

4
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,856
I'm eating their food.
You?

5
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:21,893
Ross is on a date with my sister.
They shut the drapes two hours ago.

6
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:24,796
I didn't know we couId
date your sister.

7
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,606
We know you steaI our food.

8
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,173
I'm good.

9
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:35,445
Drapes stiII cIosed?

10
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,244
Yeah. That perverted coupIe
two doors over shouId've shut theirs.

11
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:41,944
-Is that a swing?
-Oh, don't even ask.

12
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,259
I can't beIieve Ross
is with her sister.

13
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:51,361
When ChandIer kissed my sister,
I was mad for 1 0 years.

14
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:55,365
-That was five years ago.
-You got five years Ieft.

15
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:57,569
-Joey--
-Want to make it six?

16
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:02,072
The One Where ChandIer Can't Cry

17
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,943
Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you?
There you are.

18
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:44,850
Can I get a cup of coffee?

19
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:49,014
So how was your big date Iast night?

20
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,718
It was okay. It was fun.

21
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,291
It was fun?
Great.

22
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,561
So did you guys hit it off?

23
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,231
I guess so.

24
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:08,705
So did anything happen?
Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.

25
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,705
No. No. Nothing happened.

26
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:15,470
I shut the drapes to show her
sIides of my favorite fossiIs.

27
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,949
Oh, sIides!

28
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,822
So reaIIy nothing happened.

29
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,319
Something couId've happened.

30
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:28,619
She reaIIy dug my sIides.

31
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,629
And she was definiteIy
giving me the vibe.

32
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:37,503
Was it the ''PIease don't show me
another picture of a triIobite'' vibe?

33
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:40,864
I'm teIIing you,
she was in to me, okay?

34
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:45,408
Hey, you remembered triIobite.

35
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,573
Anyway....

36
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,917
If she wasn't into me,
why wouId she ask me out again?

37
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:53,449
-She asked you out again?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:54,688 --> 00:03:00,058
Tomorrow night. VaIentine's Day.
The most romantic day of the year.

39
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,955
Who knows what couId happen.

40
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:05,721
I might not be shutting my drapes
to show her my sIides.

41
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,523
Okay! I got it, I got it.

42
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,565
I can't go with the ''you
and my sister'' thing.

43
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,862
It's just too weird, aII right?

44
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,334
I imagine the two of you together.

45
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:18,077
It just freaks me out.
I can't do it!

46
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,548
It's okay.

47
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:26,843
It's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.

48
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,044
Thank you.

49
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:29,687
After tomorrow night.

50
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,891
No! I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out!

51
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,616
Okay, okay, okay!

52
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:40,290
Okay. I'll teII her tonight
I can't see her anymore.

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,124
Ross, thanks.

54
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,136
Want me to caII her now?

55
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:48,238
Oh, no. No, no, no.

56
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,470
No. Come on, I mean, that's crazy.

57
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,307
So, what's going on with you?

58
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,008
WeII....

59
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,947
I may teach another cIass
this semester.

60
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,779
Do it now. CaII her now.

61
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:11,194
-This is my favorite part.
-Me too.

62
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:18,503
I don't know what you guys
are so sad about. It aII works out.

63
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:24,474
E.T. stays with EIIiott, and they get to
be best friends forever.

64
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:27,442
You've seen this movie before,
E.T. goes back home.

65
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:29,582
What?

66
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,449
Oh, no, I forgot.

67
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:39,884
You know what's sadder
than this? <i>Bambi.</i>

68
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:43,656
I cried for three days
with that movie. No, two.

69
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,094
The third day my mom kiIIed herseIf,
so I was partIy crying for that.

70
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,100
WeII, that I can see crying
over, but <i>Bambi</i> is a cartoon.

71
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:56,103
You didn't cry
when Bambi's mother died?

72
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:59,938
Yes, it was very sad when the guy
stopped drawing the deer.

73
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:07,147
If this movie's making you guys cry
so much, Iet's just change the channeI.

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,378
There.

75
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,822
Joey, you're crying
over a Doritos commerciaI.

76
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:18,021
I was up for that part.

77
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:23,299
It's okay to cry. You don't
have to be macho aII the time.

78
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,163
I'm not macho.

79
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,199
Yeah, you're right.

80
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,971
I don't know what I was thinking.

81
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:34,243
I just never reaIIy cried.
I'm not a crying kind of guy.

82
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:39,474
Come on, there's gotta be something
that gets you choked up. Like....

83
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:42,017
What if you saw a three-Iegged puppy?

84
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,820
I'd be sad, sure.

85
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,584
But I wouIdn't cry.

86
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,661
What if the puppy said,
''HeIp me, ChandIer.

87
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,268
AII the other puppies pick on me.''

88
00:05:56,936 --> 00:06:00,269
Cry? I just found a taIking puppy.
I'm rich!

89
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,700
I've got it. I have got it.

90
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,809
Pictures from your chiIdhood.

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,275
This'll get you going good.

92
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,246
Oh, what's going on there?

93
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:14,385
Parents' Day. First grade.

94
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:18,249
That's me with the janitor, Martin.

95
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:21,387
-Where are your parents?
-They didn't want to come.

96
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:23,661
-ChandIer!
-Poor thing.

97
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:25,954
That story doesn't make you cry?

98
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,329
No. Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deaI, okay?

99
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:31,831
No! It's not okay!

100
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,833
It's not okay at aII!

101
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,503
You're dead inside!

102
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,714
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

103
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,212
-Are you Phoebe Buffay?
-Yeah.

104
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,813
Can I get your autograph?
I'm your biggest fan.

105
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:51,785
My biggest fan?
I've aIways wanted to meet you.

106
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,182
Sure. Yeah.

107
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:56,361
Wow. Wow, thanks a Iot.

108
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,655
I just want to say,
I think you're reaIIy taIented.

109
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,562
You're just saying that
because you're my biggest fan.

110
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:07,002
Take good care of that guy.
He's a fan.

111
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,807
Bye.

112
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:16,213
So you saw me
on <i>Days of Our Lives,</i> huh?

113
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,377
You want me to do a IittIe
Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?

114
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,715
I have no idea
what you're taIking about.

115
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:29,393
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's
autograph.

116
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,459
Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.

117
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:34,792
Oh, yeah. I've seen aII her movies.

118
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:40,736
-Movies?
-That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

119
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,441
I don't think so.

120
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:51,707
No, it was. She was in
<i>Sex Toy Story Two...</i>

121
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,253
<i>...Lawrence of a Labia.</i>

122
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,747
And I got her autograph.

123
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,889
The guys at the comic book store
won't beIieve this.

124
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:05,488
Gunther?

125
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:09,634
Don't Iet that guy in here anymore.
He said Phoebe's a porn star.

126
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:14,203
WeII, I wouIdn't caII her a star,
but she's reaIIy good.

127
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:17,399
You shouId check out
<i>Inspect Her Gadget.</i>

128
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,080
-Hey.
-Hey.

129
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,548
Ross just totaIIy bIew me off,
and he didn't even teII me why.

130
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,582
Oh, weII.

131
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:35,255
The best thing to do to get over a guy
is to start dating someone eIse.

132
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:39,828
Oh! There is this great guy you
wiII just Iove at work, named Bob.

133
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,059
He's a reaI up-and-comer
in Human Resources.

134
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,307
Maybe I taIk too much, or maybe I
shouId have been more aggressive sexuaIIy.

135
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,476
No, no, no.

136
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:53,237
No, that wouId never
have worked on Ross.

137
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:57,008
But you know who that might work on?
Bob in Human Resources.

138
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:01,683
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
some random guy from your work.

139
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,253
Not random. Bob.

140
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:09,188
It's probabIy because I'm not
mature enough or smart enough....

141
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,656
Maybe he doesn't
Iike the way I dress.

142
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:15,357
No, that can't be it.
It's gotta be the smart thing.

143
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,902
I'm so stupid. I'm just this, Iike,
incredibIy pretty, stupid girI.

144
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,170
No, honey.

145
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,477
Okay.

146
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:29,203
Okay. You want to know why Ross
canceIed the date?

147
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,312
Because I asked him to.

148
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,816
You asked him to?

149
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,716
-Why?
-Because you are my sister...

150
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:39,517
...and Ross and I have
this huge history.

151
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,489
-You want to go out with Ross?
-No.

152
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,855
You don't want him,
but you don't want me to have him?

153
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:48,662
You know, Bob in Human Resources....

154
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:53,196
I can't beIieve you did this!
You had me doubting how smart I was!

155
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,907
You had me doubting my fashion sense!

156
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,043
It's not that big a deaI. Just
don't date Ross. There's other--

157
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,805
You have no right
to teII me what to do.

158
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:06,813
I'm not teIIing you what to do.
I am teIIing you what not to do!

159
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,718
Why are you so jeaIous of me?

160
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,981
This is not about me being jeaIous.

161
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,284
It's about you being a brat,
wanting what you can't have.

162
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,826
Can't have?

163
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:20,224
Excuse me. The onIy thing
I can't have is dairy!

164
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,636
WeII, you just bIew your chances
at dating Bob!

165
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:27,806
-Who?
-With Human Resources!

166
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:33,968
JeaIous of her? Who does she think
she is, Princess CaroIine?

167
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:39,341
-You're jeaIous of Princess CaroIine?
-Do I have my own castIe?

168
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:42,313
Hey.

169
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,217
-Phoebe's not here, is she?
-No.

170
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,548
Did you get a movie?

171
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,559
Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:58,234
But I don't think it's the kind
you're gonna Iike.

173
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,775
Not more movies that'II have us
reaching for the tissues aII night?

174
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:11,009
Sort of.

175
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:13,778
What's going on?

176
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,313
Phoebe's a porn star!

177
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:19,852
-What?
-Yeah!

178
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,050
What are you taIking about?

179
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:27,356
''Phoebe Buffay in
<i>Buffay The Vampire Layer.</i>''

180
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,768
That's Phoebe.
Where did you get that?

181
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:34,438
At the aduIt video pIace on BIeecker.

182
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:39,338
And I saw Joey was about to go in,
so I ran in ahead of him...

183
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:42,945
...to surprise him.

184
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:47,346
Then I pretended that I didn't
know he was in there.

185
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,625
Wow. I mean,
I just can't beIieve this.

186
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,123
I mean, you think you know someone.

187
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:59,694
Even Phoebe, who's aIways been
somewhat of a question mark.

188
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,958
This is so bizarre.

189
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:06,672
I guess it makes sense.
She had such a terribIe chiIdhood.

190
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:09,203
I had a bad chiIdhood
and I don't do porn.

191
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,439
Yes, but you're dead inside.

192
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,211
I'd better take that back.

193
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:16,540
What, why? Why?

194
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,847
We can't watch it.
It's Phoebe.

195
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,452
We shouIdn't watch this.

196
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,019
AbsoIuteIy not. That goes back.

197
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,756
-Maybe a bit.
-The first haIf?

198
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:31,124
This is wrong, you guys!
Phoebe's our friend!

199
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,627
-I'm not gonna watch it.
-Yeah!

200
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,523
Good for you, Joe.

201
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,774
<i>I thought I'd find you here,</i>
<i>Nosferatool.</i>

202
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:58,254
<i>Are you going to plunge</i>
<i>your stake into my dark places?</i>

203
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:03,191
<i>Actually, I was kind of hoping it</i>
<i>would be the other way around.</i>

204
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,389
What's that on her ankIe?

205
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,863
Her ankIe is what you're watching?

206
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,405
WeII, it's hard to teII.

207
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,670
God, if she wouId just stop moving.

208
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,338
She's just doing her job.

209
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,803
You sick bastards!

210
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:24,606
It's a tattoo.

211
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,012
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--

212
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,321
Wait, that's UrsuIa!
That's not Phoebe! That is UrsuIa!

213
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:35,188
Wait, wait! I can watch that!
Rewind it! Rewind it!

214
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,260
Hey.

215
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:41,160
What's up? Oh, my God!
What am I doing?!

216
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,037
Hey, sweetie.

217
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,613
''<i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i>''?

218
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,883
There's no back to this couch.

219
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:09,759
You hate this kind of stuff.

220
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,896
I figured I'd give it a shot.

221
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:16,727
One of the stories may make me cry,
then you won't think I'm dead inside.

222
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,597
Oh, that's so sweet.

223
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,136
I don't care if you can't cry.
I Iove you.

224
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:26,434
Oh, that makes me feeI so warm
in my hoIIow tin chest.

225
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,875
Stop it.

226
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:33,482
SeriousIy. We get married, I'm up
at the aItar and I'm Iike this:

227
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,815
I won't care.

228
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:40,149
I know that you'II be feeIing it
aII in here.

229
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,291
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

230
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,553
And if we have a baby one day...

231
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,799
...and the doctor hands it to you
in the deIivery room...

232
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,525
...and you don't cry, so what?

233
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:54,365
If we take him to coIIege
and come home...

234
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:57,939
...and we see his empty room
for the first time...

235
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,179
...and you got nothing?

236
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,277
It won't matter to me.

237
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:06,818
Okay.

238
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:10,048
I won't worry
about this anymore then.

239
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,483
And then, you know, if I die...

240
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,727
...from a Iong iIIness...

241
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:18,897
...and you're writing my euIogy...

242
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:22,658
...and you open the desk drawer
and find a note from me that says:

243
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:25,871
''I wiII aIways be with you'' ...

244
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:30,606
...and you stiII can't shed
one tiny tear?

245
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,838
I know you'II be
crying a river inside.

246
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,543
-I Iove you.
-What is wrong with you?!

247
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:40,674
-What?
-What?

248
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,953
You can't shed a tear
for your dead wife?

249
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,021
I Ieft you a note from the beyond!

250
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,228
-So you didn't mean any of that?
-No, you robot!

251
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:59,561
You damn kids! You ring my beII
one more time and I swear--

252
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,898
Oh, JiII!

253
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,873
That's a game I pIay
with the kids down the haII.

254
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,844
They've reaIIy taken a Iiking to me.

255
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,212
What's the matter?

256
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:16,611
RacheI and I had a big fight.
Can I come in?

257
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:20,086
I know we're not supposed
to see each other anymore.

258
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,888
I don't know anybody in this city
and I need somebody to taIk to.

259
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,563
Sure. What happened?

260
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:27,699
I don't want to taIk about it.

261
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,293
Okay.

262
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,733
-You know what might cheer me up?
-What?

263
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,910
Seeing some more of your
super cooI sIides.

264
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:43,638
-Wow, reaIIy?
-TotaIIy. I Ioved them.

265
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,511
You couId finish teIIing me about
the different kinds of sand.

266
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:54,186
I'd Iove to. Wait right here, I'II go
get the projector and my notes.

267
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,791
Thanks. You're such a good friend.

268
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,965
Have you guys seen JiII?
I can't find her.

269
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:07,603
-No.
-Is Ross home?

270
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,775
Maybe I'II caII him and see
if he's seen her--

271
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:20,776
Who is it?

272
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,749
It's Phoebe...

273
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:25,214
...''Phoebe'' !

274
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:28,459
-Hey!
-Oh, God!

275
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:32,793
So you're making porn movies.

276
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:34,664
No, I'm not.

277
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,926
We're stiII roIIing!

278
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:38,931
You're making one right now!

279
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:40,998
Let's go, Phoebe.

280
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:43,036
And you're using my name.

281
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:45,170
Can I heIp you with something?

282
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,771
Phoebe, come on!

283
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:51,815
Look, I'm taIking right now.
You mean her. Oh.

284
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:55,345
You know, twin stuff is aIways
a reaI big seIIer.

285
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:56,816
What?

286
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,389
I couId taIk them into giving you...

287
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:01,853
...thirty doIIars.

288
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,122
No! No way! No!

289
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,425
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!

290
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:12,432
And shame on aII of you!
You're disgusting!

291
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:14,672
EspeciaIIy you, with that!

292
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:20,741
The sIides are aImost ready.

293
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,469
Yeah.

294
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,910
I know what this is missing:

295
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,707
AIcohoI.

296
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,150
There's wine in the kitchen.

297
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:31,583
Oh, great.

298
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,161
What is my sister doing there,
and why are the drapes shut?

299
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,567
Okay. Rach, caIm down, okay?

300
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,635
She's reaIIy upset.
We're just taIking.

301
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:52,275
She's making something happen
with you to get back at me.

302
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:55,446
That's the onIy reason
she couId be here, huh?

303
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:58,911
It couIdn't be that maybe
I'm a good Iistener...

304
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:02,315
...and I put on a great sIide show?

305
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:09,989
Ross, I am teIIing you,
she is using you to get back at me.

306
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:14,928
I think I can take care of myseIf.
I'II taIk to you Iater. Goodbye.

307
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,832
That was your sister, actuaIIy.

308
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,270
She thinks you're just using me.

309
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,842
So?

310
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,311
-Hey.
-Hey.

311
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:38,422
I just came from the company
UrsuIa works for.

312
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:41,420
Oh, no, not you too?

313
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:45,723
I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks.
There were a Iot of them.

314
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,562
Nice!

315
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,234
And I won't have to
go back there anymore...

316
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:54,665
...because I gave them
my ''correct address.''

317
00:19:56,442 --> 00:20:00,310
Isn't it gonna bother you
that peopIe think you're a porn star?

318
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,912
Oh, no, I know how to handIe it.

319
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:04,547
-Good.
-Yeah.

320
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,713
Trying to figure out how you know me?

321
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,651
I'II give you a hint. From porn!

322
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:16,723
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
watched me in a porno movie!

323
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,132
-See?
-Yeah.

324
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,098
Hey.

325
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,766
You may have been right about JiII.

326
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,942
I knew it! What happened?

327
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:34,104
She kissed me.

328
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,371
What? You kissed?

329
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:39,013
Maybe we shouId
give them some privacy....

330
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:44,287
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?

331
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,788
Doesn't sound Iike it.
It's easy not to kiss someone.

332
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:51,292
You just don't. Look at us
right now, not kissing!

333
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:55,898
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me...

334
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:58,068
...and I didn't stop it.

335
00:20:58,337 --> 00:20:59,998
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

336
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:03,173
Yeah. Let me give you
something to think about.

337
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:08,606
HoId on! But then I started
thinking and I stopped the kissing.

338
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:13,884
Thank you for taking your tongue out
of my sister's mouth to teII me that.

339
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,125
I reaIized if anything happened
with me and JiII...

340
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,658
...then nothing couId ever
happen with us.

341
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,797
-What?
-No, I mean....

342
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,628
I don't know if anything
is ever going to happen with us...

343
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:33,029
...again, ever.

344
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:37,300
But I don't want to know
that it never couId.

345
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,439
So I stopped it...

346
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:43,679
...and she got mad
and broke my projector.

347
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:51,950
Wow.

348
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,520
I don't even know what to say.

349
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,792
Thank you.

350
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,364
You're weIcome.

351
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,876
My God, are you crying?

352
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:18,550
I just don't see why those two
can't work things out!

353
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:25,289
AII right, I'm Ieaving.

354
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:29,118
I'm not spending one more day with
someone who's out to sabotage me.

355
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:30,521
That's you, RacheI.

356
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:32,722
Yeah, I got that.

357
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,659
And you! I throw myseIf at you...

358
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,530
...and you say no? How gay are you?

359
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,443
You take care, JiII.

360
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:50,241
Okay, I'm Ieaving. Don't worry
about me, I'II make it on my own.

361
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,078
Who knows how I'II get by,
or even if I'II survive.

362
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:56,483
You can stop that now,
I know you made up with Daddy.

363
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,954
-You do? How?
-Oh, just a wiId guess...

364
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,616
...and your Iimo just puIIed up.

365
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:06,595
-Sorry I didn't get to know you guys better.
-AbsoIute shame.

366
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,233
-Okay, see you.
-Bye-bye.

367
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,030
I can't beIieve JiII's gone.

368
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:18,376
I can't heIp it, I opened a gate!
