00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:09,078
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

2
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:12,258
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...

3
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:16,258
...for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,898
Sure, neighbor! Come on in!

5
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:21,291
Is Janine around?

6
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,966
She's at dance class.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,464
Can I check my room?

8
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:27,640
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,970
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,013
It's like a guy never lived in here.

11
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:40,483
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

12
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:42,212
It is?

13
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:46,217
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

14
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:51,292
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

15
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,998
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

16
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:57,863
This is a "guy's" place.

17
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:01,199
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

18
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:09,541
And your head's gonna be under a big,
brown, drying, big, drying-- It's not good.

19
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,352
-You're right. I'll talk to her.
-Talk to her. Be a man!

20
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:15,384
-I'm a man.
-Defend yourself!

21
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:19,050
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

22
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,783
Be right there, sweetums.

23
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:24,921
Totally different situation.

24
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,402
The One With Ross' Teeth

25
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:05,938
Hey, guys.

26
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,073
-How was breakfast with Hillary?
-Okay.

27
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:11,971
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

28
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:15,580
Is this Hillary, your
hot assistant chef, Hillary?

29
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,175
The one that stares at me
when I come in?

30
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:23,317
The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

31
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:26,754
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

32
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,226
Why don't you set us up?

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,366
Are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?

34
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:38,504
Come on, I'm serious.

35
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:42,732
Okay, I'll do it, but as long as
you promise you won't marry her.

36
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:47,436
Fine, l--
What if she's the one?

37
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:50,912
Man, you have a problem.

38
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:54,776
Rachel?

39
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:58,890
I'm making up flyers to try
to get new massage clients.

40
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:01,686
Can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copier?

41
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:06,264
Sure, but they might think it's weird
since I don't work there anymore.

42
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,158
Oh, my God! What happened?

43
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,368
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

44
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:14,003
Well, that's great! Congratulations!

45
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:17,973
A year ago.

46
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,574
You've lasted all year! Good for you.

47
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,884
You could still use the copier
where I actually work.

48
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,850
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

49
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,321
Kim will freak out.
She doesn't like me.

50
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:36,894
-I don't think my boss likes me.
-I don't think mine likes me.

51
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,996
Maybe it's a universal thing.

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,897
Maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

53
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,563
Let's head off to work.

54
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:55,908
-Thank you.
-Sure.

55
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,912
You will not believe this.

56
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,052
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

57
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,188
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

58
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:05,516
A little. He seems really nice.

59
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,750
-Good kisser.
-What?

60
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:09,695
What?

61
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,653
-You kissed him?
-Totally.

62
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,329
Phoebe, are you serious?

63
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,061
He came in and introduced himself.

64
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:20,569
The next thing I know,
we're making out!

65
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:23,808
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

66
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:27,101
Phoebe.

67
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:30,806
I'm supposed to ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

68
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:33,714
No, yeah, I should.

69
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:47,796
Hey, Joey.

70
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:51,934
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

71
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:54,936
Do you know this kid?
Is it a relative?

72
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,041
No. I just thought it was cute.

73
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,711
That's what I was afraid of. Okay....

74
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,445
I really want you to feel
at home here, but...

75
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,585
...some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

76
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:08,743
Like what?

77
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:12,482
Like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

78
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,449
We can't have that.

79
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,457
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

80
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:21,964
I don't know this baby. I don't know
if she's a famous artist or not.

81
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:28,671
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

82
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,139
I'm sorry. I wanted to make
the place a little nicer.

83
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:33,937
But it's too much stuff.

84
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:38,480
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

85
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:42,644
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

86
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,178
I just thought--

87
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:46,951
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

88
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,116
But come on.

89
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:51,797
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

90
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,560
It's a curling iron.

91
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:02,832
Well, that's okay then.

92
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:06,510
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...

93
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:10,774
...and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

94
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:15,844
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

95
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,991
-It's clean.
-It feels different.

96
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,557
It's dry.

97
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:25,821
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

98
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,232
Also what is with
these chips you bought?

99
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:32,232
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

100
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,274
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

101
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,718
Kim, hi.

102
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:05,561
I handed in that marketing report, and
I never got to hear what you thought.

103
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:06,972
I didn't read it.

104
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:14,510
The spring line's really gonna be
great this year, huh?

105
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:24,516
I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

106
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,250
Tell me everything.

107
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,227
Hey, guys.

108
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,264
What's up?

109
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,199
You know....

110
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,064
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,666
What happened to your teeth?

112
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,275
I whitened them.

113
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,006
Really?

114
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,881
What do you think?

115
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,645
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

116
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,179
Come on, seriously.

117
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,355
-They're really, really, really white.
-What was wrong with your old...

118
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,257
...human teeth?

119
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:09,799
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

120
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:13,031
-How much longer?
-A day.

121
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:16,668
Tonight is your date with Hillary.

122
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,903
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

123
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:26,311
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

124
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,018
She will be after tonight.

125
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,584
Oh, Rach.
Do you notice anything--?

126
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:36,284
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

127
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,857
You guys are never gonna
believe this...

128
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:45,298
...but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

129
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:46,835
-What?
-Oh, my God!

130
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,509
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

131
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:53,644
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...

132
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,371
...it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

133
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,313
I am proud of all my friends today.

134
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,246
I can't believe Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

135
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,684
I'm so jealous!

136
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,151
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

137
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,357
Chandler, please. Come on.

138
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,032
Look at him.

139
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,997
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,864
Here.

141
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,302
Who's the silver fox?

142
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:28,969
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

143
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,137
Oh, wait.

144
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,908
"Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please."

145
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:37,853
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

146
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:42,058
-What?
-Ralph doesn't look like that guy.

147
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:47,095
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack--

148
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:52,361
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy!

149
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:53,539
What?

150
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,409
I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

151
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:01,910
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!

152
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,640
Why would the copy guy say
he's Ralph Lauren?

153
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,715
To get you to make out with him!

154
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,051
This will make them look less white.

155
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,234
Nope.

156
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:25,336
Colors that don't work are...

157
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:29,565
...blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

158
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,573
Do you wanna try this highlighter again?

159
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:37,439
No, I think it poisoned me a little.

160
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:41,551
The date starts in an hour.
What am I'm gonna do?

161
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:47,091
Maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

162
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:51,354
Oh, great! So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

163
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,761
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you--

164
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,502
Whoa!

165
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:00,001
We're not 13 anymore.

166
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,941
This is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

167
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,111
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

168
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,542
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

169
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,080
What?

170
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,077
Half the people-- I mean--
Just try it and see.

171
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,586
I am not putting on makeup.

172
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:22,285
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

173
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,291
No! Demon! Demon!

174
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:35,465
Our drawers will smell nice, and
we didn't waste these pantyhose.

175
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,670
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

176
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,570
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

177
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,841
We've got to organize
the wrapping paper.

178
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:49,917
I've really gotten in touch with
my feminine side enough today.

179
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:53,524
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

180
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,859
This has been a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

181
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,623
I just feel like I need
to be in a "guy" place...

182
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,799
...do kind of a "man" thing.

183
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,403
You go over to Joey's and...

184
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,574
...drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

185
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,141
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

186
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:18,010
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

187
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,184
I'm sorry. We do.

188
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,083
I don't know why I said that.

189
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:29,961
Hey, Chandler.

190
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,463
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

191
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,265
No, thanks, Josephine.

192
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,739
Ross, I was wondering if--

193
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,208
Oh, my God! Where are all the men?

194
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:03,754
-Hi, Kim.
-Hi, Rachel.

195
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,357
Remember what happened yesterday?
Well, it didn't happen.

196
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:11,034
You didn't cancel the fabric order?

197
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,470
Okay, two things didn't happen.

198
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:17,642
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

199
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:20,335
Well, it turns out that's not true.

200
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:22,571
It's not true?
That's interesting.

201
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,343
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copier...

202
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:31,319
...yesterday during lunch, and
that keycard belonged to you.

203
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,518
You think I made out with him?

204
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:34,682
Listen to me...

205
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:38,863
...sleeping with Ralph is not
gonna get you my job.

206
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,329
I don't want your job. I don't.

207
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,865
This is a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

208
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:48,039
Nobody made out with him.
I didn't use my keycard yesterday.

209
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,742
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

210
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,136
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

211
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,031
Yeah. Nothing happened.

212
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:18,601
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

213
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:27,879
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

214
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,414
Soon, I hope to open
my own restaurant.

215
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,751
You're a really great listener.

216
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:40,424
Most guys I go out with,
they talk and talk.

217
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:46,163
It's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?

218
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,328
I've been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

219
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:56,741
Come on, I want to know.

220
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,970
Okay. I'm from Long Island.

221
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:06,811
I came to the city for college.

222
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:10,852
I have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...

223
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:15,651
...I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you.

224
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:24,492
If you sear the stems of the flowers
first in a frying pan...

225
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:27,570
...your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

226
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:30,606
Joey, that is such a great tip!

227
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:35,438
Monica, I need to talk
to the girl with the flowers.

228
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,750
Okay, but I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...

229
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:43,717
...out of a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

230
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,155
I love birds.

231
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:50,058
What is the matter with you?

232
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,557
-What?
-You're arranging flowers!

233
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,225
You got dead flowers!

234
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,438
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers!

235
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:02,398
This is not Joey!

236
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,736
Look, I am still Joey, okay?

237
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,879
Flowers, they're just nice to look at.

238
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:13,609
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

239
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:16,554
You're turning into a woman.

240
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,613
No, I'm not.

241
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,325
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

242
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:25,993
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

243
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,295
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

244
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,463
Oh, my God!

245
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,535
I'm a woman!

246
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:44,181
So now she thinks that I made out
with him to get her job.

247
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,943
-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
-I did.

248
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:52,283
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

249
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:57,121
What if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

250
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,130
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

251
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,994
Did she ever think of that?

252
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,206
You were with Kenny today.

253
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,273
Just for a second.

254
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,310
Phoebe, what am I gonna do?

255
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,880
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with him.

256
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:24,549
I'm not gonna sleep with him.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

257
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:26,983
Sleep with Kenny.

258
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:34,160
-That wouldn't help me.
-Oh, yes, it would.

259
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,462
I've had a really good time tonight.

260
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:43,368
I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

261
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,076
Me neither.

262
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,679
I've had a really
good time too, you know.

263
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,411
Are you gonna eat that bread?

264
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:59,385
I just like the smell.

265
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:03,552
You make me laugh.

266
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,125
Would you like to move to the couch?

267
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,734
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

268
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,567
How about all the way?

269
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,239
Okay.

270
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,217
Wow, cool poster.

271
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:33,950
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

272
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:36,790
So...

273
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,788
...where were we?

274
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,298
Are those your teeth?

275
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:52,008
You can see them, huh?

276
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:54,838
Yes. They're insanely white.

277
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,414
I did that for you.

278
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,319
What's the matter with you?

279
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:06,248
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1999!

280
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,033
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

281
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:21,001
Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

282
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:24,435
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

283
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,141
Okay, look.

284
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,642
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

285
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:33,613
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

286
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:34,945
Oh, really?

287
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,584
Yeah, he dumped me.

288
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:42,252
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

289
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:45,623
Even though you're a very, very...

290
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:48,197
...very beautiful woman...

291
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:52,035
...I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

292
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,535
But he said,
"And you will never get promoted...

293
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:59,677
...especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...

294
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,708
...in the Ralph Lauren machine."

295
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:06,582
You expect me to believe--

296
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,649
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

297
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,135
Oh, my God.

298
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:35,540
He gave you the coldest look I've
ever seen. It's like he hates you!

299
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,271
Then it is true!

300
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:43,111
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

301
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:46,118
Oh, honey, come here.

302
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:48,225
Oh, it'll be okay.

303
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,889
We've all been there.

304
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,595
You and Ralph?

305
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,096
Kenny the copy boy.

306
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,747
-I need to talk to you.
-What's the matter? You upset?

307
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:20,488
Would you like me to get
a pint of ice cream and two spoons?

308
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,459
No, no, no ice cream. Look....

309
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,928
We gotta get rid of all
this girlie stuff in here.

310
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,033
I gotta be a man!

311
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:33,294
The living room has to
remain a guy place, okay?

312
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,335
That's the way it has to be.

313
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,169
I'll just put it all in my room.

314
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:40,038
Good. Great.

315
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,780
Thanks for being so understanding.

316
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,710
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

317
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,452
But you could put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

318
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,486
I mean, if you want to.

319
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:55,782
Okay.

320
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:58,724
And maybe the watering can there.

321
00:21:58,897 --> 00:21:59,886
Sure.

322
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:02,726
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

323
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:07,164
Joey, do you want me to put
it all in your room?

324
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,566
Okay.
