1
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,392
Listen....

2
00:23:47,632 --> 00:23:49,725
You think I have a chance with Janine?

3
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,700
We've been through this.

4
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:53,336
Don't do this to yourself.

5
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:55,970
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

6
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:59,632
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited...

7
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:01,436
...that I just kissed her!

8
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:03,840
-Are you serious?
-That's great!

9
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:05,847
Yeah, well, we'll see.

10
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,008
You kissed her?

11
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,182
We kissed it up real nice.

12
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,226
So you ended up with Janine.

13
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:19,955
Well, congratulations,
you won fair and square.

14
00:24:20,131 --> 00:24:23,396
Yeah, it was real neck and neck
there for awhile.

15
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:26,002
So you kissed. Then what happened?

16
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:28,732
I came over here to tell you guys.

17
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:31,798
So she's waiting over
there for you?

18
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:34,568
Yeah.

19
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,518
The One With The Apothecary Table

20
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:21,450
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

21
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:26,221
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

22
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:27,489
Okay.

23
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,629
-Okay, now I'm really leaving.
-All right.

24
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:33,963
But can you just...

25
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:36,139
...just leave your lips?

26
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:44,314
Have you kissed her yet?

27
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:47,784
It's awesome!

28
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,486
I could do it forever.

29
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:54,418
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

30
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,355
I'm so glad you said, "cooks."

31
00:25:58,296 --> 00:26:02,528
Look, it's like
imagine your best kiss ever.

32
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,261
Right? Okay, now multiply that
by, like, 10.

33
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:12,538
Wait a second, you dated Ross.

34
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,942
And you date Chandler.
Okay, multiply it by, like, 50.

35
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:21,743
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

36
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:24,120
We still get your bills and stuff.

37
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,887
Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

38
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,192
I'm not your garbage man.

39
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:33,154
I'm your mailman.

40
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:36,122
Monica, look.

41
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:39,130
Here is that table that I ordered.

42
00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:43,567
-You got it from Pottery Barn?
-Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

43
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:46,036
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

44
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:47,939
A pharmacist.

45
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:50,180
"A pharmacist."

46
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,815
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

47
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:56,620
I hate Pottery Barn too.

48
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:59,948
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

49
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,920
You took off your pants and
got under the sheets.

50
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:06,889
I was tired.

51
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,896
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

52
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:13,002
She hates mass-produced stuff.

53
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:16,104
She thinks her furniture should
have a story behind it.

54
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,308
This has a story behind it.

55
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:22,774
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

56
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:27,776
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

57
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:32,054
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

58
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,123
Hey! I made that for her.

59
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:38,128
-You made pottery?
-Yeah.

60
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,389
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

61
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:47,230
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

62
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:49,633
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

63
00:27:49,907 --> 00:27:52,398
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

64
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,739
I love these little drawers.

65
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:57,880
Oh, look! It says that
it holds 300 CDs.

66
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:01,107
Just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

67
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:05,448
Your what?

68
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:07,422
-What?
-What?

69
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,389
Enjoy the catalog, sweetheart.

70
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:17,893
So the farmer says:

71
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:21,036
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."

72
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:24,871
I'm so glad you're together.

73
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:28,272
We wanted a couple to go out with,
and now we have one.

74
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:30,409
We're a couple of couples.

75
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:34,651
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

76
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,582
And, Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

77
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:42,549
Thanks again, man.

78
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:46,897
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

79
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:48,531
-That'd be great!
-Okay.

80
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,134
But at least let us
bring the wine.

81
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:54,769
-You don't have to.
-I insist.

82
00:28:57,975 --> 00:28:59,966
-You'll get the wine, right?
-Yeah.

83
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:03,976
-Okay, good night.
-See you tomorrow.

84
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:05,645
Can't wait.

85
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:13,149
How are we going to get
out of that one?

86
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,825
I can't handle two
nights in a row with them.

87
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,023
What's wrong with them?

88
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:25,996
They're just a little...

89
00:29:26,304 --> 00:29:27,532
...blah!

90
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:30,135
Blah?

91
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:34,399
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just....

92
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:37,374
She's very loud for such
a small person.

93
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,116
They're my best friends.

94
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:46,848
Are you saying we can't go out?
Because that'd be a problem.

95
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,851
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

96
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:52,095
Just not two nights in a row.

97
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:57,092
-Okay?
-I guess.

98
00:29:57,301 --> 00:29:58,825
Thank you.

99
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,303
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

100
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:18,588
What a great table!
Where did you get it?

101
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,523
Guess.

102
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,356
A flea market?

103
00:30:23,994 --> 00:30:26,519
I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

104
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:31,557
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

105
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,398
You can just imagine
that this is where...

106
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:38,267
...they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

107
00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:42,369
You can almost smell the opium.

108
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:45,774
Almost.

109
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:47,275
How much was it?

110
00:30:47,585 --> 00:30:49,052
Just only 500 bucks.

111
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,015
Five hundred bucks at a flea market?

112
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:54,691
I thought you meant how much was it...

113
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:56,926
...when it was new, back then.

114
00:30:58,496 --> 00:31:01,556
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

115
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:06,163
-A dollar?
-And 50?

116
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:09,064
So it was like
one and 50 dollars.

117
00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:13,234
-They gave you the old-time pricing.
-Yeah.

118
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:16,073
Well, what period is it from?

119
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:17,876
It's from yore.

120
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:20,242
Like the "days of yore," you know?

121
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:22,677
Yes, I do.

122
00:31:22,987 --> 00:31:26,115
-It's just perfect.
-Oh, good.

123
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:28,449
I bet it has a great story too.

124
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,786
Did they tell you
where it's from or...?

125
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:34,553
Yes, that I know.
This is from White Plains.

126
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,464
White Plains.

127
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:40,602
It sounds like such a magical place.

128
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,601
-I'm here.
-Hi!

129
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,172
Oh, my God!

130
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,108
-You like it?
-Oh, my God!

131
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,010
It's my new apothecary table!

132
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:58,446
Phoebe will be here any second.
She can't see this.

133
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:01,418
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

134
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:03,320
I got it at Pottery Barn.

135
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:06,419
I know. I bought the same one.

136
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,326
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

137
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:12,229
-I said ours was an original.
-Why?

138
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:14,427
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

139
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:17,971
She hates Pottery Barn?

140
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,834
She says it's all mass-produced...

141
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:25,013
...nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

142
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:30,878
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

143
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:34,283
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

144
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:37,790
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

145
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,290
I forgot they made sheets!

146
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:48,138
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

147
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:49,996
It's not like she hates you.

148
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:52,265
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

149
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,644
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

150
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:01,242
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

151
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:05,948
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

152
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:10,725
You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
A twin!

153
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:18,229
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

154
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:22,063
-Hey, cool sheet!
-You like it?

155
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:25,070
-You want to know where I got it?
-Sure.

156
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:26,674
At a flea market.

157
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,577
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

158
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:34,879
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

159
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:40,956
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

160
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:43,853
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

161
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:47,290
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers...

162
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:50,932
...but you couldn't, because
you paid for dinner last night.

163
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:54,963
Thanks. But it's just
gonna be me tonight.

164
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:59,072
-What happened to Janine?
-She's really sick.

165
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:02,444
-That's too bad.
-Yeah, she's been in there all day.

166
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,275
High fever, nose problem.
It's...

167
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:08,849
...phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

168
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:13,322
Monica! Chandler!

169
00:34:15,426 --> 00:34:18,918
I'm sorry about tonight. I don't
know if Joey told you...

170
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:22,189
...but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

171
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:27,269
Have a great time, huh?

172
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:33,201
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

173
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:36,012
Oh, no, she really is sick.

174
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:38,178
Then why is she going to a play?

175
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:40,747
Well, you know, "Starve a fever...

176
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,781
...go to a play for a cold."

177
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:47,788
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

178
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:52,121
She didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

179
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:53,489
I'm so sorry.

180
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:56,626
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

181
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:01,931
Because she thinks that
you are blah.

182
00:35:04,174 --> 00:35:06,768
And that you, Monica,
are too loud.

183
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:08,535
What?!

184
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:12,175
What?

185
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,541
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

186
00:35:14,818 --> 00:35:16,718
She was lying to our faces?

187
00:35:16,987 --> 00:35:19,217
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?

188
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,859
-We couldn't have been nicer to her.
-And I am not blah. I am a hoot!

189
00:35:25,362 --> 00:35:27,728
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

190
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:29,592
I'm sure she said it...

191
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:33,166
...because she was nervous because
you're my best friends.

192
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,361
And it was our first date.

193
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:38,439
Plus, she's really sick.

194
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,478
You said you made that up!

195
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,581
But isn't the sick thing
better than the play thing?

196
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,709
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

197
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:55,552
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

198
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:59,227
-She'll come around, I promise.
-Of course we will.

199
00:35:59,496 --> 00:36:02,090
-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
-Okay.

200
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,160
I do not like that woman!

201
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:10,663
I can hear you!

202
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:13,907
I am loud!

203
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:27,818
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new--?

204
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,919
Old sheet.

205
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:31,485
Oh, sure.

206
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,989
My apothecary table!

207
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:37,792
-What?
-No!

208
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:41,797
-Where did you get this?
-At Pottery Barn, okay?

209
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:46,205
Oh, my God!

210
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,774
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

211
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:55,384
If they've ripped off our table...

212
00:36:55,652 --> 00:36:59,452
...ours must be worth much more
than one and 50 dollars.

213
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:03,057
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

214
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:06,160
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

215
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:08,330
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

216
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:12,633
Ross, calm down. I'll give
you the 80 cents.

217
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,499
Okay, one more time.

218
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,573
Would you like some orange juice?

219
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:25,281
-Perfect decibel.
-I know!

220
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:30,683
What are you guys doing?

221
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:34,515
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

222
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:38,351
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

223
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:42,156
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

224
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,060
-What do you say?
-I'd like to...

225
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:46,327
...but I'm not sure if
we have the time.

226
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:50,139
Very funny. I don't know
what to do.

227
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,308
I really want you to get along.

228
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:55,238
Please come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

229
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:57,136
-We owe you?
-That's right.

230
00:37:57,381 --> 00:38:00,350
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

231
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:02,676
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

232
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:04,748
I looked like an idiot.

233
00:38:04,955 --> 00:38:06,445
And I was humiliated.

234
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:08,350
And I only made $200.

235
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,859
We didn't give you any money.

236
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,895
You don't think I know that?

237
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:25,467
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...

238
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:26,868
...the Sahara desk...

239
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:29,169
...or the Parker console table.

240
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,881
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

241
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,545
-I know, I went a little crazy.
-A little?

242
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:38,585
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

243
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,320
Look at that!

244
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:45,552
The ornamental birdcage!
Large.

245
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:51,391
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

246
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:55,900
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

247
00:38:57,407 --> 00:38:58,533
Fascinating.

248
00:39:00,878 --> 00:39:03,142
Another amazing find!

249
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:07,849
-I bet this has a great story too.
-It does.

250
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:12,681
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

251
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:17,719
A lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

252
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:20,795
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

253
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:24,864
Well, there's yore.

254
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:30,232
And, you know, yesteryear.

255
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:35,870
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

256
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:38,512
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...

257
00:39:38,782 --> 00:39:40,909
...and I think you should...

258
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:42,913
...you should ask Rachel to help.

259
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:44,813
He doesn't need my help.

260
00:39:45,022 --> 00:39:48,355
I think he's ready to get rid
of the-- What'd you call it?

261
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,355
The "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

262
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,128
Really?

263
00:39:58,302 --> 00:40:02,295
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need--

264
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:04,597
Here's 60 bucks.

265
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:08,972
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial flea market...

266
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,974
...and get me some stuff.

267
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:17,613
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

268
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,516
-I do want to.
-She does want to.

269
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,121
-She does want to.
-Yeah!

270
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,759
-I'm gonna get my purse.
-Okay.

271
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:28,854
Hey, can I have all this stuff
when she makes you throw it out?

272
00:40:29,032 --> 00:40:33,162
Well, sure, and I'll show you
right where you can put it.

273
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:42,333
I guess the flea market was
just better last time.

274
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:45,672
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

275
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,283
Look at this. Pottery Barn.

276
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:53,284
You know what? Don't look at it.

277
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,890
-Seriously, don't look at it.
-Look!

278
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,127
There's the table
they stole from us.

279
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,386
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

280
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:06,560
That fan kind of looks like ours
and the birdcage and....

281
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:09,835
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

282
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,201
No, it's not.

283
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:14,808
Come on, ours is totally different.

284
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:18,673
I mean, we don't have the--
We don't have that lamp.

285
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:23,883
And that screen is on
the other side.

286
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:28,084
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

287
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:30,792
Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!

288
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:33,920
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

289
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:38,192
I wanted this stuff, and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

290
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:41,268
-Come on, don't be mad.
-No, but I am mad.

291
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:44,736
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...

292
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:46,966
...and it's in my living room...

293
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:50,907
...and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

294
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,280
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

295
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:56,746
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

296
00:41:58,622 --> 00:42:01,182
I can't! I can't!

297
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:03,249
Unless....

298
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,123
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

299
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:09,399
No, I'm not gonna move out!

300
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,695
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

301
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:18,540
-Yes! I would so move out.
-Then I don't have a choice.

302
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:21,404
-I have to buy that lamp!
-That's right.

303
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:25,605
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

304
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:33,986
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

305
00:42:34,324 --> 00:42:36,952
I did. I really did,
and I've got to say...

306
00:42:37,194 --> 00:42:40,561
...I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

307
00:42:40,764 --> 00:42:42,595
I guess I was just nervous.

308
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:45,427
-That's understandable.
-Don't worry about it.

309
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:46,897
So we can go out again?

310
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:49,368
-Absolutely.
-Well, good.

311
00:42:55,979 --> 00:42:57,344
See?

312
00:42:57,647 --> 00:42:58,636
Wasn't that fun?

313
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,814
We have got to move.

314
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:03,082
What?

315
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,580
I knew it!

316
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,822
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

317
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,752
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance...

318
00:43:13,997 --> 00:43:15,259
...is you talking about it.

319
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:18,957
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost
myself in the movement."

320
00:43:22,372 --> 00:43:24,602
You know, I know you're talking...

321
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:27,538
...but all I hear is,
"Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah."

322
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:30,940
All right, you and me!
Let's go right now!

323
00:43:31,248 --> 00:43:32,442
All right, enough!

324
00:43:33,483 --> 00:43:36,748
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

325
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,214
I really think you could take her.

326
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,854
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

327
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:48,688
All right.

328
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:52,196
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

329
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:54,665
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

330
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:58,932
-They said stuff to me too.
-I know, I'll talk to them about it.

331
00:43:59,843 --> 00:44:01,367
They mean so much to me.

332
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:03,909
They're like my family, you know?

333
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:07,342
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time....

334
00:44:08,718 --> 00:44:12,415
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

335
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:13,953
It can't.

336
00:44:14,224 --> 00:44:16,089
I'm very upset.

337
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:18,994
Okay.

338
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:21,423
Would it help if I apologized?

339
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:23,295
Yeah.

340
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:25,296
That'd be very helpful.

341
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,934
What did I tell you about the hall?

342
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:38,011
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

343
00:44:39,616 --> 00:44:42,176
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

344
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:49,221
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...

345
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:51,586
...I would like that too.

346
00:44:52,462 --> 00:44:54,430
-Great.
-Now, come on.

347
00:44:58,268 --> 00:45:00,566
-I'm glad we worked it out.
-Me too.

348
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,635
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

349
00:45:02,906 --> 00:45:05,932
-Or I'll hear you.
-That's it, big girl!

350
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:09,774
Wait!

351
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,840
You'd better run!

352
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:17,681
Did you hear that?

353
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:22,150
-What am I gonna do?
-I'm sorry, man.

354
00:45:24,394 --> 00:45:25,986
-Want to go watch?
-Yeah!

355
00:45:34,004 --> 00:45:37,030
You know, I'm not sure
you could have taken Janine.

356
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:39,237
I could have taken her.

357
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:42,901
-She's much bigger than you.
-Are you kidding me?

358
00:45:43,113 --> 00:45:47,743
I know what to do with tall girls.
You go for their knees.

359
00:45:50,854 --> 00:45:53,721
-How you doing?
-So did she move out?

360
00:45:54,057 --> 00:45:55,684
Pretty much.

361
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:58,120
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

362
00:45:58,395 --> 00:46:00,454
When it's not right, you know it.

363
00:46:00,797 --> 00:46:03,891
-You okay?
-I'll be all right.

364
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:08,264
-You know what would cheer you up?
-What?

365
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:13,104
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

366
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:16,540
I think you should come.

367
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,613
You're right, that did cheer me up.
