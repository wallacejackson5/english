00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:05,088
The reason I asked you to brunch. . .

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:08,365
. . .is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,529
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:12,488
I hope it's you.

5
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,490
-I hope it's you.
-Me too.

6
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:18,323
First of all,
I love you both so much.

7
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,128
-You're both so important to me.
-Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,841
I was thinking we could
come up with a system. . .

9
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,169
. . .where we trade off
being maid of honor.

10
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,490
-Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine--
-Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:34,441
Hypothetically.

12
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:35,722
Still.

13
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,927
If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,567
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.

15
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:47,926
-That's a pretty good idea.
-I'll do that. So, who's yours?

16
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:52,642
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:57,611
-Why is that the best part?
-I don't have to.

18
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:03,768
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,446
I'd like to make a toast.

20
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,608
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing. . .

21
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:13,326
. . .my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that--

22
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,365
-Really not deciding.
-Fine.

23
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,727
Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,242
-You're marrying Chandler Bing?
-Yeah.

25
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:24,762
Good luck!

26
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:28,727
Oh, and good luck to you too!

27
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,004
What a nice lady.

28
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,609

30
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:12,328
Yeah!

31
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:15,764
-Die Hard, still great.
-Yep.

32
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:17,725
Let's make it a double feature?

33
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,127
What else you rent?

34
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,604
Die Hard 2.

35
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,404
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

36
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,652
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

37
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,327
-Joey, we just saw it.
-And?

38
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,489
It would be cool to see it again!

39
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,406
-Yeah! Die Hard!
-Die Hard!

40
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,924
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

41
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,326
Is everything okay?

42
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,128
Yeah, I just got plans.

43
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:50,530
Well, John McClane had plans.

44
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,325
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up. . .

45
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,803
. . .and starts calling
everybody "bitch. "

46
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:00,767
What are you talking about, bitch?

47
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,172
-Hey, Rachel.
-Yeah?

48
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:08,763
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

49
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,326
Really?

50
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:13,725
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean I'm just--

51
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,326
Wait a minute.

52
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:21,961
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

53
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,526
Oh.

54
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:26,924
Well, if that's what you want.

55
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,607
No way, Phoebe.
I want to be Monica's.

56
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:33,964
-Why does it even matter?
-Why does it matter to you?

57
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,323
Because this one is now.

58
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,242
And it's two of our best friends.

59
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,848
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

60
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,890
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

61
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:49,612
You wouldn't.

62
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:55,332
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this. . .

63
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,730
. . .but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

64
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,009
I know you've done it at least twice.

65
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:03,932
-Yeah, but Phoebe--
-Please let me finish.

66
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,131
I guess that was it.

67
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,127
Okay.

68
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:14,407
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

69
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,524
Oh, thank you so much!

70
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,327
Yay.

71
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,924
I'm gonna marry someone good.

72
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:25,802
Oh, I know.

73
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,532
Better than Chandler.

74
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,324
-What happened?
-I don't know.

75
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,292
We fell asleep. That is all.

76
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,882
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

77
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,410
All right, well, I'd better go.

78
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:00,490
-I think that would be best.
-Yeah.

79
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,285
-I'll talk to you later.
-Okay.

80
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:05,769
-But not about this.
-No, never. Never!

81
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,289
-Bye.
-No touch. No touch.

82
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,204
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

83
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:19,847
This woman overheard that
I was marrying you. . .

84
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,850
. . .and she wished me good luck.

85
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,242
That's sweet.

86
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,251
No, it was more like a "good luck. "

87
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,729
So, what did this woman look like?

88
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,128
She was, like, 30,
dark hair, attractive.

89
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,565
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

90
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,289
Was it someone you dated in college?

91
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,688
No, I only dated two girls
in college. . .

92
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,164
. . .both blond, both not attractive.

93
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,606
Let me check this out.

94
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:50,373
-What are you doing?
-Well, let's see.

95
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,286
Okay, is that her?

96
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:54,812
Oh, my God, yes!

97
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:58,568
-Who is she?
-Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

98
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,285
Did you break up with her?

99
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,964
No, we're still together.

100
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:11,170
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

101
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,443
-Why?
-She came back the third summer. . .

102
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:17,123
. . .and she'd gotten really fa--

103
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,413
-Fat?
-I did not say fat.

104
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:25,167
I said fa--

105
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,051
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

106
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:30,971
Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:35,286
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

108
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,767
Apparently she does.

109
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:39,771
You know what they say:
"Elephants never forget. "

110
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,162
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

111
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:51,567
Hey, what's going on?

112
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:53,650
She's Monica's maid of honor.

113
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:58,051
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

114
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,727
You have been maid of honor before?

115
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,528
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

116
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,329
That's it. I am maid of honor.

117
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,569
-No, I am.
-How come you are?

118
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:14,333
Because I cared enough to lie.

119
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,253
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

120
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,852
We could have an audition.

121
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:22,051
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

122
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:24,369
-What do you mean?
-When I want a job. . .

123
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:27,650
. . .I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see. . .

124
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:28,649
. . .I get the part.

125
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,651
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

126
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,969
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

127
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,972
-It's better than us deciding.
-Oh, this is crazy.

128
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:40,649
-Can't we just flip a coin?
-No, coins hate me.

129
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,242
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

130
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,327
Hi!

131
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,689
Ross, sweetie.

132
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,606
Hey there, handsome thing.

133
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:02,245
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

134
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,448
Hey.

135
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,605
Just brought back your videos.

136
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:16,567
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

137
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,650
No. No, we don't.

138
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,003
Yes, we do.

139
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:23,644
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.

140
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,852
I don't know what
you're talking about.

141
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,972
Come on, admit it.

142
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,164
That was the best nap you ever had.

143
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,851
I've had better.

144
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,251
Okay. When?

145
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,726
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

146
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,372
I said it, okay?

147
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,450
But it's over, Joey!

148
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:52,886
I want to do it again.

149
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,684
We can't do it again.

150
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,248
-Why not?
-Because it's weird!

151
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,052
Fine.

152
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,322
You want a drink?

153
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,923
-Sure. What do you got?
-Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

154
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:18,246
Chandler.

155
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,283
I just figured out who you are.

156
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,643
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

157
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:27,527
-You're Louis Posen.
-Who?

158
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,847
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

159
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:34,284
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

160
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,648
Do you know why?

161
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,926
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

162
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,530
No, but because he thought
I was too fa--

163
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,764
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

164
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,441
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

165
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:54,651
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 1 6 years ago.

166
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,482
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

167
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:02,129
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

168
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,927
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

169
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,687
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

170
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,202
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.

171
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,722
-One being the highest.
-Ten is the highest.

172
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,084
-Why is 1 0 the highest?
-Because it's the highest.

173
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,085
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

174
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,932
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

175
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,126
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

176
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,489
I don't want to marry Chandler.

177
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,849
-I've got cold feet.
-It's gonna be okay.

178
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,362
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

179
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:41,007
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.

180
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,329
Look, Monica. . .

181
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,564
. . .getting cold feet is very common.

182
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,082
It's just because
of all the anticipation.

183
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,292
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

184
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,927
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

185
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:59,482
You don't get to keep the gifts.

186
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,483
Drawing on your own experience.

187
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:03,887
Very good.

188
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,323
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

189
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,727
Thank you, judges.

190
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,889
-Kiss ass.
-Oh.

191
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,888
-Okay, Phoebe.
-Yes, Your Honor.

192
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,571
We're now in the ceremony.

193
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,729
Monica is about to say, "I do" . . .

194
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,203
. . .when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.

195
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:22,727
What do you do? Go!

196
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,441
When Monica was a little girl. . .

197
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,484
. . .I remember that--

198
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:31,612
Ow!

199
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:33,206
-Very good!
-Oh.

200
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,730
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

201
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,204
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

202
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:42,092
Hey, you want
a little taste of Pheebs?

203
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:47,330
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

204
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,966
We haven't even prepared--

205
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,403
-Go!
-Okay, okay, okay.

206
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,922
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as--

207
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:59,411
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.

208
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:04,408
I met-- I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds. . .

209
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:09,323
. . .and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25. . .

210
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,803
. . .although he seemed
like a 6-year-old.

211
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,971
Oh.

212
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,803
Thank you. Thank you very much.

213
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:21,247
I've known them
separately and together.

214
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:26,408
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are in the presence of love.

215
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,810
So I would like to raise my glass. . .

216
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,605
. . .to Monica and Chandler. . .

217
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:36,125
. . .and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

218
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:39,843
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

219
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,172
Wow.

220
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,603
-Great speech.
-Yeah, it really was.

221
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:46,802
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:51,763
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

223
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,208
Okay.

224
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:01,603
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

225
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,281
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel. . .

226
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,212
. . .while we were
showering together, naked.

227
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,404
And she's back in the game!

228
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:26,802
Julie. Hi.

229
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,163
Chandler Bing.
I guess you remember me.

230
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,404
Hello, Skidmark.

231
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,403
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

232
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,406
It's pretty clear.

233
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:44,443
I owe you a long, overdue apology.

234
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,963
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because of your weight.

235
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,604
That's why you broke up with me?

236
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,804
You didn't know that?

237
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,923
Well, I guess my work here is done.

238
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:09,123
First of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

239
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:10,852
You should be proud.

240
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:15,644
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.

241
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,088
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

242
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,171
Really? I won.

243
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,206
-What?
-I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

244
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,962
-Well, then I demand a recount!
-Actually, it wasn't that close.

245
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,131
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

246
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,489
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

247
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:35,241
Heads.

248
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,607
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!

249
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,249
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her. . .

250
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:49,328
. . .vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

251
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:54,131
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

252
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,922
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

253
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,248
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

254
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:05,526
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

255
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,922
Why would I care about that?

256
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:15,125
No reason. I'm just saying that. . .

257
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,526
. . .that's where I'll be.

258
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,207
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

259
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:44,565
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

260
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,247
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

261
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,406
-Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
-I'd love it if I could do both.

262
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:57,125
All right, I have to ask.

263
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,562
What?

264
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,008
Will you break up with me
if I get fat?

265
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,328
What?

266
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,684
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

267
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,123
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

268
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,721
In one year?

269
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:14,089
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?

270
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,051
That's not the point.

271
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:22,041
I know it was a stupid reason to
break up with someone, but I was 1 5.

272
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:26,292
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

273
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,611
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

274
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:31,882
You called me fat.

275
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,202
Wait a minute.

276
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,927
-That was totally different.
-How?

277
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:39,762
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

278
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:44,364
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

279
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:47,007
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

280
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:51,001
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

281
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:58,243
This is one of the things that
I can apologize for later.

282
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,163
What I mean is, you're Monica.

283
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,331
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

284
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,082
Keep going.

285
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,172
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down. . .

286
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,290
. . .and I will still love you.

287
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,930
Even if I were to shrink down
to 2 inches tall?

288
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:20,849
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

289
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,282
I love you.

290
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:29,326
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.

291
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,202
Hi, Pheebs.

292
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,766
-Hi.
-Hi.

293
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,571
I just want to apologize.

294
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,088
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

295
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:42,683
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

296
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,249
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.

297
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:51,529
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.

298
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,531
And I was thinking about it.

299
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,765
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

300
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,964
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

301
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,408
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

302
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:07,411
-Just in case.
-Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

303
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:10,764
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

304
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:13,083
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

305
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,922
Here's a picture from one Halloween
when she dressed up as a bride.

306
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,691
She made me carry her train. . .

307
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:21,885
. . .which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

308
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,127
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.

309
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,052
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

310
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,813
-Oh.
-Something. And. . .

311
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:36,370
. . .vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

312
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:38,922
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

313
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:42,288
This stuff is great.

314
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,723
I forgot this was in here.

315
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:50,563
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

316
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:54,328
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed. "

317
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,241
And it's blue.

318
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,329
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

319
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,726
You do?

320
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,730
-Why?
-Because I think it means more to you.

321
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,763
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

322
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:18,004
It's fine.
I mean, this is something. . .

323
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,728
. . .that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 1 4?

324
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:24,931
No, I was 1 0.
I just developed early.

325
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,604
Man alive!

326
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,125
-Hey, what's going on?
-Hey!

327
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,291
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

328
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,929
Oh, that's great!

329
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:41,370
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

330
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,569
I have really specific ideas.

331
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,769
We should meet four times a week.

332
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,726
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

333
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:52,530
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

334
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,329
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

335
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,972
She's gonna be yours.

336
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,252
Great nap.

337
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,284
It really was.

338
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,485
What the hell are you doing?

339
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:44,812
God!

340
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,406
Excuse me.
