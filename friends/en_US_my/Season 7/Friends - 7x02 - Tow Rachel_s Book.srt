1
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:06,524
-Hey. Who wants French toast?
-I'll have some.

2
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,724
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

3
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:14,201
-What's the matter?
-My hand feels weird.

4
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:16,243
I guess it's because I'm engaged!

5
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:20,526
-When will that start getting annoying?
-Start?

6
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:23,963
Let's start the wedding plans.

7
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:25,287
-Okay.
-Already?

8
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:29,491
We got a lot to do. We gotta think
about the flowers, the music--

9
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,411
-I have thoughts on the music.
-Too many cooks. . . .

10
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:38,165
Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and say the right name.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,648
-What in God's name is that?
-Oh, my God, the wedding book?

12
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:48,127
I haven't seen that
since 4th grade.

13
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:53,247
This baby has everything. Take,
you know, locations for instance:

14
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:57,041
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically. . .

15
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:59,482
. . .then by square footage.

16
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,290
That is so smart.

17
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:05,841
Break it off. Break it off, now.

18
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,528
The One With Rachel's Book

19
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:10,721
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

20
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,883
That conclusively proves. . .

21
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:50,721
. . .that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

22
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,530
Let's take a look--

23
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,968
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

24
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:58,602
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

25
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:01,121
Oh, my God. Of course.

26
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:04,000
Would you please excuse me
for a moment?

27
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:07,688
Do you know each other's hometowns?
Why don't you. . .?

28
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:09,931
What's going on?

29
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:14,523
Well, not much. I was just thinking
that since they just got engaged. . .

30
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,922
. . .it would be nice
if they have privacy.

31
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:20,647
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

32
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:27,007
Okay, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

33
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:29,328
Nothing. Why?

34
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:32,925
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

35
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:36,169
Yeah, it is. My movie starts
in five minutes.

36
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:43,211
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

37
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:48,925
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movie?

38
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,850
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents. . .

39
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,128
. . .but tell me how this is for music.

40
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:00,922
A string quartet for the processional,
a jazz trio for cocktails. . .

41
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:03,327
. . .the Bay City Rollers
for dancing. . . .

42
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:06,325
Wait, that was
for my 6th grade wedding.

43
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:10,925
You couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek. . . .

44
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,201
Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

45
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:19,891
Mon, do you have another pillow,
something a little snugglier?

46
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:23,124
Why are you napping here
instead of at your place?

47
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:25,323
-The duck.
-What, the duck?

48
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:27,807
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

49
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:32,920
Well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there. . .

50
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,289
. . .and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

51
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,091
Do I get to look at this book. . .

52
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,409
. . .or is it just for people
involved in the wedding?

53
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:46,204
Of course you can look at it.
I want your opinion.

54
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:47,447
Here you go.

55
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:50,126
-What about centerpieces?
-Centerpieces!

56
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:53,250
-Roses or lilies?
-Definitely roses.

57
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,368
I think they're more "wedding-y. "

58
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:06,001
-But lilies are the clear choice.
-Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

59
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:11,728
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

60
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,322
I'm gonna get cranky.

61
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:18,568
Joey, there's a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

62
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,967
Yes, it is perfectly good. . .

63
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:24,522
. . .and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

64
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,521
What?

65
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:30,841
-All right, I'm gonna go.
-Joey, what did the duck do?

66
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,925
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

67
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:48,325
Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?

68
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:54,126
What the hell is in that face cream?

69
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,328
That's so soft.

70
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,928
Pillowcases!

71
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:32,648
"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
Her father, the vicar--"

72
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,120
Vicar?

73
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,522
"--wouldn 't be home for hours.

74
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,603
Her loins were burning.

75
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:44,721
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his--"

76
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,328
This is a dirty book!

77
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:06,327
Phoebe?

78
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,091
Oh, Ross, hi.

79
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:14,327
-Phoebe, what are you doing?
-Sorry, I'm with a client right now.

80
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:18,605
-Phoebe!
-Okay, let's talk outside.

81
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,645
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

82
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:25,281
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

83
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,084
And they knew about it?

84
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,166
Okay, Ross, what is this really about?

85
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:37,447
This is my home, and I want to be
able to come and go when I want.

86
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:40,883
I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

87
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:42,810
I don't know what the big deal is.

88
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:45,845
I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment. . .

89
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:50,165
. . .when I want to kick back
with a puzzle-- Beer, cold beer.

90
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,883
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

91
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:58,927
Sweeping. Why?
Does it turn you on?

92
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,167
No.

93
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:07,370
What if I was sweeping a chimney?

94
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:11,408
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

95
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:17,331
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

96
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,851
Joey, where did you learn that word?

97
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:30,964
Where do you think. . .

98
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:32,681
. . .Zelda?

99
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:38,563
-You found my book?!
-Yeah, I did!

100
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,404
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

101
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:46,525
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have,
but you got porn!

102
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:51,289
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

103
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:56,162
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

104
00:07:56,412 --> 00:08:00,087
It's a healthy expression
of female sexuality. . .

105
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:04,166
. . .which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

106
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,164
You got porn.

107
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:32,721
-Hello.
-Hi, is Phoebe here?

108
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,768
-No, she's out for the night.
-Oh, great!

109
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,761
Can I help you with something?

110
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:41,929
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

111
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:43,965
Yes, I am.

112
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:48,161
Great! Dad?

113
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,325
Thank you so much.
I'll pick him up in an hour.

114
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:06,921
Your parents must've been thrilled
when you told them you were engaged.

115
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,282
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

116
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,442
I remember when we first got engaged.

117
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,722
-I've never heard that story.
-Dad, you don't--

118
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:17,048
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

119
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,244
I still don't know how.

120
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:24,889
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

121
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,490
What a sweet story.

122
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,290
At least you're not hearing it
at your 5th grade Halloween party.

123
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:35,084
They wanted a scary story.

124
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,927
We're really excited
about our wedding plans.

125
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:43,165
Pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the wedding fund.

126
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:50,246
-What?
-You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

127
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:52,881
You have the wedding fund, don't you?

128
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,209
We have it.
Only now we call it "the beach house. "

129
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,286
You spent my wedding
fund on the beach house?

130
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:03,931
We're sorry. We assumed. . .

131
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,891
. . .that when you turned 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

132
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,607
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

133
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:12,042
So you've had seven years
of beach fun. . .

134
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,408
. . .and you can't put a price on that.

135
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:18,723
We do feel bad about this.

136
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,684
We saved again
when you dated Richard.

137
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:23,446
Then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

138
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:27,651
What about Chandler?

139
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:30,082
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd propose.

140
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,848
I didn't start drinking
enough at the start of the meal.

141
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,803
I can't believe there's no money
for my wedding.

142
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,048
Maybe, if your father hadn't tried. . .

143
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:42,846
. . .to sell ice over the lnternet.

144
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:46,567
-It seemed like such a simple idea.
-Stupid. The word is "stupid. "

145
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,884
Enough. I don't want
to hear about it anymore.

146
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:51,451
Good luck, Chandler.

147
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,841
Okay, now I'm going to. . .

148
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,040
. . .touch you.

149
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,809
That's soft.

150
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:00,445
Do you think your parents
could help pay for it?

151
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,448
I don't know.

152
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:05,844
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

153
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,327
Saving the rest for her divorce.

154
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:13,128
And any extra cash my father has,
he saves for his yearly trips to. . .

155
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:15,120
. . .Dollywood.

156
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:20,808
-What happened at dinner?
-My parents spent the wedding fund.

157
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,040
My God, what did you order?

158
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:29,928
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

159
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:33,488
You guys will have to get
married in, like, a rec center.

160
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:38,162
-Honey, it's gonna be okay.
-No, it's not gonna be okay.

161
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:42,366
-No swing band, no lilies.
-It's gonna be okay.

162
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,211
I mean, you don't need to have this. . .

163
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:48,205
. . .rustic ltalian feast.

164
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:50,482
You don't need this custom-made. . .

165
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:54,611
. . .empire waist, duchess satin gown.

166
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:56,490
You can wear off-the-rack.

167
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,211
It's really gonna be okay.

168
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:07,405
The important thing is, we love each
other and we're gonna get married.

169
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:11,127
Do you even understand what
"off-the-rack" means?

170
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,843
Why don't you pay for it yourself?

171
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,485
How? I don't have any money.

172
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,603
-I have some.
-How much?

173
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:19,847
Well, close to. . . .

174
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:34,083
-Are you kidding me?!
-How much?

175
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,045
-Enough for wedding scenario A.
-Really?

176
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,846
How great are you, you little saver!

177
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:42,965
This is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

178
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,970
You guys are so made for each other.

179
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,368
You're not suggesting we spend
all the money on the wedding?

180
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,125
Yeah.

181
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:57,121
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years. . .

182
00:13:57,332 --> 00:14:01,405
. . .and I have some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

183
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:05,127
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.

184
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:11,128
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

185
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:15,086
I realize that, honey, but I won't
spend all the money on one party.

186
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,442
Honey, I love you.

187
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,968
But if you call our wedding
a party one more time. . .

188
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,725
. . .you may not get invited.

189
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:29,166
We can always earn more money.
We're only gonna get married once.

190
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:33,650
I understand, but I have to put
my foot down. The answer is no.

191
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:36,928
You're gonna have
to put your foot down?

192
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,327
Yes, I am.

193
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:44,246
Money and a firm hand.

194
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,960
Finally a Chandler
I can get onboard with.

195
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,967
CENTRAL
PERK

196
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:57,521
-Hey, Rach.
-Joey.

197
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:01,846
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

198
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:06,125
I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

199
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:10,128
No, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

200
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:11,961
Something's on fire.

201
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,044
I don't smell anything.

202
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:17,809
You know what? It's probably
just your burning loins.

203
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:25,205
-Hey, what are you guys talking about?
-Nothing.

204
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,524
Damn, this coffee's cold.

205
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:32,848
Do you mind if I heat this
on your loins?

206
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:40,321
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey. . . .

207
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,764
I guess you bought that book
after we broke up.

208
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:47,482
I did, because I wore out my first
copy when I was with you.

209
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,120
Oh, yeah?

210
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:54,126
Well, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

211
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:56,321
'Sup?

212
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:01,526
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

213
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,730
Excuse me, ladies.

214
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,125
I'm sorry?

215
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:10,607
My massage client. Arthur.

216
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:13,610
His daughter said some guy
that worked for me. . .

217
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,643
. . .gave him a really weird massage.

218
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,605
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

219
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,090
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

220
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,931
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

221
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:28,130
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks. . .

222
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:32,371
. . .and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

223
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:38,121
Well, he's never coming back.
You just cost me $80 a week.

224
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:41,449
This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

225
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:44,525
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

226
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:45,642
You could've sent him away.

227
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:48,804
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

228
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,926
He said he liked that!

229
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:58,125
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,524
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

231
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,921
-His daughter was hot.
-Gotcha.

232
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:16,407
Listen. . .

233
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,563
. . .I've been thinking.

234
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:24,890
It's not fair of me to ask you to
spend all your money on our wedding.

235
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:27,930
I mean, you work really hard for that.

236
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,288
-Well.
-Well, you work for that.

237
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,806
Look, I've thought about it too.

238
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:39,284
I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all the money on the wedding.

239
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,967
-You do?
-Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

240
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:48,331
Look, when I proposed,
I told you. . .

241
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:51,803
. . .that I would do anything
to make you happy.

242
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:55,249
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy. . .

243
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,488
. . .then that's what we're gonna do.

244
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:00,201
You are so sweet.

245
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,960
What about the future and stuff?

246
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,402
Forget about the future and stuff.

247
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:10,926
So we only have two kids.

248
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:14,801
We'll pick our favorite and
that one will get to go to college.

249
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:18,326
-Have you thought about that?
-Yeah.

250
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:20,085
How many kids were we gonna have?

251
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,887
Four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

252
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:27,409
What else did you think about?

253
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:30,445
Well, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

254
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,206
Like a small place outside the city. . .

255
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,529
. . .where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes.

256
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:39,491
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar. . .

257
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:44,044
. . .and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

258
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:48,171
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

259
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:54,606
You know what?

260
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:58,366
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

261
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,809
-Sure you do.
-No.

262
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:06,808
I want everything that you've
just said. I want a marriage.

263
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,206
You sure?

264
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:15,009
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

265
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:23,647
When you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

266
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,610
But you meant dog, right?

267
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:30,803
-Totally.
-Good.

268
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,810
Hello, Zelda.

269
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:48,809
-Who are you supposed to be?
-The vicar.

270
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:53,451
-Do you even know what a vicar is?
-Like a goalie, right?

271
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,045
Look, that's enough.

272
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:00,170
You make stupid jokes
and sleazy innuendoes. . .

273
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:02,169
. . .and it's just not funny anymore.

274
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:05,523
I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.

275
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,850
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

276
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,648
All right, that's it.
You want to do it? Let's do it.

277
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:20,367
That's right.
I want to do it with you.

278
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:26,563
Been trying to fight it,
but you said all the right things.

279
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:27,961
I did?

280
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:31,409
Yeah, I been waiting for so long
to get on that body.

281
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:34,721
-This body?
-Yeah, that's right.

282
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,928
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

283
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:40,647
You're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife in chapter seven.

284
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:44,966
Come on, now. Don't keep me
waiting. Take your clothes off.

285
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:49,245
But I'd keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

286
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:52,124
I don't want to. I'm scared.
