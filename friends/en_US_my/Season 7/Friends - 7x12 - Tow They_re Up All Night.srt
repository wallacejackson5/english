00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,322  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

2
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,207  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, technically, it started
7 billion years ago.

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,645  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay. Fine, I'll stop.
No teaching, okay?

4
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:18,521  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
We'll just watch the pretty light
streaking across the sky.

5
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:20,131  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay?

6
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:24,810  X1:097 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whose official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

7
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:29,609  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:486 Y2:524
There it is. Oh, look at that!

8
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,610  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

9
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,005  X1:245 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's a plane.

10
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:40,647  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, all right, 1 700 bags
of peanuts flying that high...

11
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:42,564  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
...that's pretty amazing too.

12
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:48,162  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I wonder if you can see my apartment.
- No, you can't.

13
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,766  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What?
- I don't know.

14
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:55,602  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:486 Y2:524
Man, look at all those stars.

15
00:00:55,812 --> 00:01:00,761  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
Infinite space. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

16
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:03,247  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Know what else makes you wonder?
- What?

17
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,966  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:524
Check out the rack on that chick.

00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,569  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:052 Y2:089
We've been out here for two hours...

21
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:53,923  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:132
...and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

22
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:57,283  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.

23
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,284  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:052 Y2:091
No, I'm not.

24
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,967  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:052 Y2:131
Then why are you wearing
Monica's jacket?

25
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,280  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:052 Y2:094
Because it's flattering!

26
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,887  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:090
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

27
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:17,288  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We're going too. We got a movie.
- I won't say no to a movie.

28
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:20,131  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, Pheebs, we just actually
wanted to be alone.

29
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,402  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Sh. Get me out of here.
- Oh, okay.

30
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:27,081  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Hey, Ross.
- What?

31
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,884  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Check it out.
- Is it the comet?

32
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:33,007  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:524
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

33
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,201  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:052 Y2:089
I can't believe...

34
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,801  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:052 Y2:131
I bring you to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

35
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:40,446  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:052 Y2:132
...one of nature's
most spectacular phenomena...

36
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:45,009  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:052 Y2:126
...and all you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

37
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:50,372  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:091
You know, there's two women, dude.

38
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,165  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
Show me where.

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,963  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:052 Y2:093
Okay. Right up here.

40
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:04,809  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
Joey, where's the pipe
that was holding the door open?

41
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,206  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

42
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,008  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I do.

43
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,648  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joey!
- What? Hey, don't look at me!

44
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:25,403  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:524
You wanted to come up here and look
for some stupid Burger King comet.

45
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:29,330  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's called the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

46
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,882  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, Bapstein was a very
well-respected astronomer from...

47
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,645  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No!

48
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,409  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Monica.
- She's sleeping.

49
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,287  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
I know. Just a quick question.

50
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,650  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which one was <i>Deep Impact</i>
and which one was <i>Armageddon</i>?

51
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:02,045  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
<i>Deep Impact</i> was the one
with Robert Duvall.

52
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:05,767  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:524
<i>Armageddon</i> is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

53
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:09,848  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Sorry, I just can't sleep.

54
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:18,445  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:524
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

55
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,086  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and wearing those hats
with the flowers on it.

56
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,250  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:524
Because every time I look
at that cover, I'm like...

57
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:29,404  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's in the living room,
where there's also a light...

58
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,682  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and no one will
kick you in the shin.

59
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,441  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

60
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:49,449  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
Please don't be a spaceship.
Please don't be a spaceship.

61
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,650  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, thank God.

62
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,045  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
How could you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

63
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:38,245  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
I took out your battery! How can...?
Don't interrupt me!

64
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:42,290  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica! Monica!

65
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,045  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:524
Come on!

66
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,962  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe this!

67
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:53,251  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right, well, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

68
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,522  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

69
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:59,449  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Help us! Please, help us!

70
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:03,691  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

71
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,447  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ross.

72
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:10,451  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

73
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:14,168  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know. I wasn't finished.

74
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,242  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
But don't worry!

75
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,248  X1:092 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

76
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:33,840  X1:321 X2:393 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sh!

77
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:41,850  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm milk and it would help me sleep.

78
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,326  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
With a wok?

79
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,572  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:524
My boring book didn't
put you to sleep?

80
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,047  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
It got interesting.

81
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,243  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
Damn you, Oprah!

82
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:56,085  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
Here, let me make the milk.
I'm up anyway.

83
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,681  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what we could do
now that we're up?

84
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:01,531  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
We could just talk
to each other all night long.

85
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,121  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Like when we were first dating.
It'd be fun.

86
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,090  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, that does sound fun.
- Yeah.

87
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:09,643  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

88
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,683  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:524
The second sister dies?!

89
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,771  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

90
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,405  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, I was talking
about the book I was reading.

91
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:26,525  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:446 Y2:524
The second sister dies in
<i>Archie and Jughead Double Digest</i>?

92
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:29,727  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's correct.

93
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:38,931  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's more comfortable.

94
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:40,770  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Sure.
- Okay.

95
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:45,449  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to Milan?

96
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,166  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
If this is your idea of sexy talk... .

97
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:52,560  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

98
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,602  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
What contracts?

99
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:57,521  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please tell me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get.

100
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:58,801  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Like what?

101
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,970  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

102
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:05,802  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:444 Y2:524
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

103
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,480  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
Those contracts had to go out today.

104
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,603  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
You didn't give me any contracts.

105
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,770  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, I did. I put a little
Post-it on it that said:

106
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:17,647  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Must go out today," and I
underlined "today" three times.

107
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:22,164  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then I put a little heart in the
corner so I wouldn't seem too bossy.

108
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,404  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
You never gave them to me.

109
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:29,128  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:446 Y2:524
If we went to the office, you would see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

110
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:33,211  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

111
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:37,928  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:524
Maybe I'm embarrassed because you
talk on the phone with your crotch.

112
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,888  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to go to the office now?

113
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:44,164  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Come on, it's late.
We're not going down to the office.

114
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:48,001  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't
want to be proved wrong either.

115
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:50,368  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, get your coat!

116
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:55,411  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

117
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:05,965  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:524
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

118
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,570  X1:187 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'll just have to jump.

119
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,972  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to land...

120
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:16,409  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

121
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:20,167  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:524
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

122
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:25,971  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middle.

123
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:29,566  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
So when you get down there...

124
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:36,162  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you go up to the roof
and you let me in.

125
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:39,610  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wait a minute. I have to do it?
- You'll be fine.

126
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,372  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'll be just like
bungee jumping, you know?

127
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:46,565  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

128
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,765  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

129
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:55,362  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.
It's a possibility.

130
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:01,728  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know. Tell you what,
let's flip to see who does it.

131
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:04,765  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You call it in the air, all right?
- Oh, all right.

132
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:12,009  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Can you see what it is?
- No.

133
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,363  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay. Well, you be careful.
- No, Ross, stop it.

134
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:16,647  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not jumping.

135
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:20,811  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my leg.

136
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:25,449  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

137
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,449  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:488 Y2:524
So it looks like we're even.

138
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,171  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, so this wire...

139
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:39,161  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
...is connected to this wire,
which plugs into here.

140
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:43,771  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
all I have to do... .

141
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,366  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

142
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,570  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well done, Pheebs.

143
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,968  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you want from me?!

144
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:10,206  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
Here's your milk.
What should we talk about?

145
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,884  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:524
What? What? What?

146
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:19,370  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

147
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:25,965  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Feel free to look...

148
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,931  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
...but I'm telling you
those contracts are not here.

149
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,600  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
How could you know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

150
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,849  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
This is what I'm saying.
You have to be more organized.

151
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:38,840  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you... Oh!

152
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,647  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
And who's this chippy?

153
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,402  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
A little young for you, but whatever.

154
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,681  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's my sister.

155
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:49,371  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? Very cute braces.

156
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,324  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start looking...

157
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,649  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:524
...because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

158
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:02,041  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

159
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:06,245  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner
came into my office after lunch...

160
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,762  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
...he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

161
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,721  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
...that said:

162
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,841  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Must go out today. "

163
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,485  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
So you just keep looking
in there, all right?

164
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:27,971  X1:230 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're not here.

165
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:30,571  X1:294 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
Puzzler.

166
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:35,564  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:524
Bit of a puzzle.

167
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:39,607  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't you check the copy room?
Maybe the contracts are in there.

168
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:42,565  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How could I have left them there?
- I don't know.

169
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,127  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:446 Y2:524
How can your genitals
make phone calls?

170
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,443  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay? It's not a perfect world.
Just go, please?

171
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,163  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Fine.
- Thank you.

172
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,370  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hello?

173
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:11,806  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:524
I still don't get it.

174
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:17,964  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
You still awake?

175
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:20,090  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. You?

176
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,965  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

177
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,200  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

178
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:31,170  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
As long as we're both up... .

179
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,731  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah?

180
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:39,642  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
I hope you're not thinking
about cleaning the living room.

181
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:47,567  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
Man, I'm starving. What the hell
was I thinking at dinner?

182
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:51,162  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Do you want soup or salad?"
Both, always order both.

183
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:57,245  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:524
You know, I'm looking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

184
00:13:57,452 --> 00:14:00,012  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
I say we just break the window...

185
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,406  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
...crawl through...

186
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:03,887  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and you know, explain later.

187
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,889  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No one's home?
- I don't think so.

188
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:07,161  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hello?

189
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:16,365  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
So when you get in there... .

190
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:27,171  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

191
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:28,561  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Noisy bitch!

192
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,806  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, what? What are you doing?

193
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,368  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you know what just happened?

194
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:43,161  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah. We had sex
and then we fell asleep.

195
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,362  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:488 Y2:524
No. We were in the middle of sex...

196
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:51,560  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and you fell asleep.

197
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:55,809  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:486 Y2:524
No. No, that's not true.

198
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,168  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, best time ever.

199
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,570  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah. You rock my world.

200
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,163  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Monica?
- What?

201
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,808  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.

202
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:15,364  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
So please wake up
so we can do it right.

203
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:19,160  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

204
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,363  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Come on, big fella.
- Okay.

205
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,563  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Give me the good stuff.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:28,167  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.

207
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:32,369  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay, I'm going
to make you some coffee.

208
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:38,370  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I probably won't spill coffee
grounds all over the kitchen floor.

209
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:40,170  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.

210
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:46,369  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi. I got you some coffee to...

211
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,770  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:524
So you got anything for me?

212
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,724  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Still no luck.
- Oh, my God.

213
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,605  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
You checked your entire desk
and all the drawers?

214
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,201  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Want me to check again?
- I wish you would.

215
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,970  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, no, it's not in there.

216
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:01,920  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
How about that drawer?

217
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:12,766  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, it's not out here.
Any chance it could be in your office?

218
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,370  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

219
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,125  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:486 Y2:524
I mean, let me check.

220
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,171  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:524
Any luck?

221
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:36,682  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
See you in my office for a minute?

222
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:41,289  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
You found them!

223
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:45,130  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not even gonna gloat.

224
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:48,449  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm just really relieved it's...
- You put these on my desk.

225
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:49,767  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I did not.
- Oh, really?

226
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:51,724  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
So they left your bottom drawer...

227
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:54,730  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
...crawled across the floor,
then jumped onto my desk?

228
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,571  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:524
How did you know
they were in my bottom drawer?

229
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,082  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am so hot for you right now.

230
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:20,127  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God!
How did you get back here?

231
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,050  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe Buffay?

232
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,044  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Fire Alarm?

233
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:34,641  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I help you?

234
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,683  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your fire alarm was in the trash.

235
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,684  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:524
- That's not mine.
- Yes, it is.

236
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:39,688  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
How do you know?

237
00:17:39,932 --> 00:17:42,810  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you dump a fire alarm,
don't use a blanket that says:

238
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,850  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
"Property of Phoebe Buffay,
not Monica. "

239
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,450  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you have a search warrant?

240
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,962  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
Because the last time I checked,
this was still America.

241
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,930  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please reattach it.
It's illegal to disconnect them.

242
00:17:56,132 --> 00:18:00,045  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Fine. But please, God, tell me
how to stop it from going off?

243
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,765  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:488 Y2:524
Press the reset button.

244
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:05,442  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

245
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,405  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh. There's a reset button?

246
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,563  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
My God!

247
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,962  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why didn't I see that?

248
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:17,080  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:524
Reset button. Reset button.

249
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,369  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is! Oh!

250
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,766  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, you have a good grip?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:43,691  X1:081 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna start to climb down you now.

252
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,443  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
- All right, just hurry up.
- Okay.

253
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:51,928  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

254
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,488  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
...or should I climb down
your back so we're...

255
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,364  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:524
...butt to face?

256
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,927  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Face to face.
- I like face to face.

257
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:04,485  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

258
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:10,211  X1:067 X2:650 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?

259
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:16,087  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
I prefer not to answer. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

260
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,522  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:488 Y2:524
When we talked about face to face...

261
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,485  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

262
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,767  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What do you want me to do?
- Just shimmy down me and drop.

263
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,291  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi.

264
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,442  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, maybe I should hang,
and you should climb down me.

265
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:48,088  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yeah? Maybe we should talk
about that for a little while!

266
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:53,007  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
- It still looks pretty far.
- It's not that far. Just drop.

267
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:54,884  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:524
Do not rush me!

268
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:07,123  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
My pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

269
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,881  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!

270
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:18,488  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
I think I twisted it when...
A quarter!

271
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,041  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:052 Y2:131
That really was
some of your best work.

272
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:27,844  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:052 Y2:093
I told you.

273
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:32,487  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:052 Y2:089
I can't believe it.

274
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:36,651  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:127
I've only got two hours
until I call in sick for work.

275
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,048  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:052 Y2:093
I have to be up in seven minutes.

276
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:44,045  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:052 Y2:132
Well, you're not gonna believe this,
but if you have seven minutes... .

277
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:46,245  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:052 Y2:093
Really?

278
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:48,085  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:052 Y2:088
You want to?

279
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,602  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:131
You get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll get the furniture polish.
