00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:03,645  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks for coming by.

2
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:07,805  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

3
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:11,530  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- It's just... .

4
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:14,206  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
Monica said "wedding. "

5
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,572  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
We thought one of you
could read something.

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,608  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

7
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:24,405  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:524
Too?

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,323  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
I kind of have something else
planned for you guys.

9
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:31,202  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you mind telling us what it is?
- Sorry.

10
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:34,603  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the QT.

11
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:37,326  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whatever it is,
I hope it involves winking.

12
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:40,966  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:43,203  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:524
I talked to one of the <i>DOOL</i> writers...

14
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:45,408  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What is <i>DOOL</i>?
<i>-Days Of Our Lives. </i>

15
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:51,007  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
You won't believe it. My character
is coming out of his coma!

16
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,129  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's wonderful.
- Wow, Joey.

17
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:56,921  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
And not only that.
I'm getting a new brain!

18
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:01,851  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
So great things are happening at work
and in your personal life.

19
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:04,485  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're getting a new brain?

20
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,326  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
They're killing off
one of the characters...

21
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,365  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.

22
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:15,488  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
What? A brain transplant?

23
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,245  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's ridiculous.

24
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:20,529  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's ridiculous that you
haven't had sex in three months.

25
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:28,687  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

26
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:31,246  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who are they killing off?

27
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,881  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
Cecilia Monroe.
She plays Jessica Lockhart.

28
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,531  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No!

29
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:39,648  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

30
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,452  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a drink.

31
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:45,126  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
The way she slaps people.
Wouldn't you love to?

32
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,805  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Don't do it.

33
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,409  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:488 Y2:524
And she's been on the show forever.

34
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:52,126  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's gonna be really hard
to fill her shoes.

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,761  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:524
Help me out here.

36
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:58,324  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
When you come out
of the brain transplant...

37
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:00,927  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
...you are going to be her?

38
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:03,925  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

39
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:10,208  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

40
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,728  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
The One With Joey's New Brain

41
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:14,961  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:446 Y2:524

SDI Media Group

42
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,764  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:052 Y2:093
Rach, so that guy there:

43
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:50,047  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:052 Y2:093
Straight or gay?

44
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:55,810  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:052 Y2:132
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight.

45
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,043  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:052 Y2:131
Knockers will help us
figure it out.

46
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,170  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:052 Y2:093
All right, straight.

47
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,650  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:524
And not subtle.

48
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,524  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
He left his cell phone.

49
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:15,332  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:052 Y2:131
We could have Gunther
put it in lost and found.

50
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:19,042  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:052 Y2:131
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.

51
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,769  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:052 Y2:126
What if he calls his own cell phone
and I answer...

52
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:26,243  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:052 Y2:126
...and we start talking
and we fell in love?

53
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:28,522  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:052 Y2:093
Would that be a great story?

54
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:31,445  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:131
Kind of like a fairy tale
for the digital age.

55
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,248  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
That does sound great.
I'm getting the phone.

56
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:37,643  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:131
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

57
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,446  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:052 Y2:132
I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

58
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:43,047  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:052 Y2:093
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

59
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:47,683  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:052 Y2:132
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.

60
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,968  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Great. I get the phone.

61
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:53,204  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

62
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:58,480  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, and until now, I didn't think
I would love again.

63
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:00,680  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Nice try.
- Wait.

64
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,890  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
How do we fairly decide
who gets the phone?

65
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:05,850  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

66
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,841  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe we could... .

67
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,126  X1:225 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ah-ha! Too slow!

68
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,926  X1:217 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ah-ha! Too cocky.

69
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,401  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm dating him.
There's nothing you can do.

70
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:29,601  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, there is.

71
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,969  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are you going to kill him
like you did Charles?

72
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,605  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my baby.

73
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:43,205  X1:317 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
<i>Cut! </i>

74
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:51,609  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
That was great. And that slap looked
so real. How do you do that?

75
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:55,327  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, just years of experience.
- Can I get some ice here?!

76
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:59,645  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just wanted to say how wonderful
I think you are.

77
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,401  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

78
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:06,444  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

79
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:09,883  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm the guy in the coma.
- Oh, that was a real person?

80
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,046  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:524
Since I'm getting your brain
when you leave the show...

81
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,049  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I was wondering if...

82
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,648  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm leaving the show?
- Why? Did you hear something?

83
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:25,328  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who told you that?

84
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,964  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:524
- One of the writers.
- Was it bald or was it tall?

85
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,924  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

86
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:34,207  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

87
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:37,967  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:446 Y2:524
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

88
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,766  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
...about a character I've played
for 20 years!

89
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,451  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:446 Y2:524
Miss Monroe...
Oh, there you go.

90
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:53,966  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, look, I have an idea.

91
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:58,324  X1:077 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial...

92
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:02,884  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and then whoever has more in common
with him gets the phone.

93
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,205  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Fine. All right.
- All right.

94
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,569  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
First name on the speed dial is "Mom. "

95
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,485  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh. I lost my mom to suicide.

96
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,408  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't use that to get the cute guy
and the last blueberry muffin.

97
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:19,086  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did I use that already today? Sorry.

98
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:23,768  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:486 Y2:524
"Ben, Carlos, David..."

99
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:27,288  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, I win. He's got Barney's
on his speed dial.

100
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,841  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
You don't know it's Barney's
the store.

101
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,560  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:524
That could be his friend's
house, a bar...

102
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,882  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
Who has Barney's the store
on their speed dial?

103
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,123  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
His new girlfriend.

104
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:51,727  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
What is that?

105
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,566  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

106
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:59,206  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
Sounds like it's coming
from across the street.

107
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,769  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my God.
- What?

108
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:05,242  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

109
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:09,007  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
He was hanging out with me and said,
"You're half Scottish, right?"

110
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,809  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

111
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:24,008  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?

112
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:27,971  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why is your family Ross?

113
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,966  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
He cannot play at our wedding.

114
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,246  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

115
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,289  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's not even a song.

116
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,726  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait. If you listen very carefully...

117
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:43,844  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I think it's "Celebration"
by Kool and the Gang.

118
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,570  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're right.
They are writing me out of the show.

119
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:56,043  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
They don't know exactly when
it's going to happen, but soon...

120
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,805  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and then that's it.

121
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,930  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

122
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:03,163  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah, thanks.
- I mean it.

123
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:06,529  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

124
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:10,930  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They love you so much.

125
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,329  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, you're right.

126
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:15,166  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you.

127
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,130  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's your name again?

128
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:19,850  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joey.
- Thank you.

129
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,162  X1:230 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:524
That is so sweet.

130
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:25,280  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
The only reason
I came up to you before...

131
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,090  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:486 Y2:524
...is because, well...

132
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:30,244  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I'm really nervous about being you.

133
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:34,331  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
If you could help me capture
the essence of the character... .

134
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,166  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:524
Help me keep Jessica alive.
Please?

135
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:40,931  X1:205 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, I will help you.

136
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:44,482  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

137
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,769  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:524
...but because I owe it to Jessica.

138
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:50,685  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

139
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:53,492  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:524
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

140
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:57,682  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Jessica Lockhart will never
step foot in this place again!

141
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,081  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:524
Never!

142
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:04,930  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
Jessica doesn't have
an English accent.

143
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,168  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
I can do an English accent?

144
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,772  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:524
That baby's going on my resume.

145
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:17,607  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

146
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:20,167  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
Remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

147
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:23,324  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
...we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

148
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:27,922  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was gonna keep it in my purse, so if
it rang, I could just pick it up?

149
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:33,170  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you remember going into my purse
and stealing the phone?

150
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,846  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ooh, now you lost me.

151
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:38,323  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You stole the phone.
- No, I didn't.

152
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:41,450  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're saying if I called it,
it wouldn't ring?

153
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:42,727  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Okay.

154
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:47,329  X1:077 X2:637 Y1:446 Y2:524
But while you dial, let me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

155
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:50,923  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, it does work.

156
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,123  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Phoebe.
- That is a different phone.

157
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:58,923  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi.
Is Rachel there?

158
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,408  X1:088 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
It's for me!

159
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:06,050  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
That is damning evidence.

160
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,924  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

161
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,402  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:524
My digital fairy tale's
about to begin.

162
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:18,167  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Would you stop doing that?

163
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:21,165  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hello? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

164
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,846  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Phoebe, you can't...
- Shh, I'm on a call.

165
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:29,766  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
Say, 8:30?

166
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,731  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:524
At my apartment.

167
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,322  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's 5 Morton Street,
apartment 14.

168
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:40,531  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
And then maybe, you know, after,
we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.

169
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,967  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

170
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,727  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:524
I will be here when he comes over.

171
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,042  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
How will you know what time
to come over?

172
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,487  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
You just said it.

173
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,601  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

174
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:05,249  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
The essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

175
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,211  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

176
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,283  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
...she owns everything...

177
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:14,047  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and every person in that room.

178
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,250  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You try it.
- Okay.

179
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,163  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's not mad at the room.

180
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:31,324  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

181
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:36,043  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

182
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:38,808  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's a little weird,
but it's getting better.

183
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:44,845  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

184
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:47,242  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's been 20 years of my life.

185
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:51,048  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.

186
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:55,080  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'll give you a chance to shake
things up. Play different characters.

187
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,651  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're so talented.

188
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:01,408  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
Probably should've just left years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

189
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:04,485  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but I just got
so comfy here and... .

190
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:07,047  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
I turned down some amazing work.

191
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,566  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Like what?

192
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,206  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, let's just say
if I'd left 15 years ago...

193
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:16,809  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
...the landscape of Mexican
cinema would be very different today.

194
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,370  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

195
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:26,567  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
But, well, now... .
Now's a different time for me.

196
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:32,166  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.

197
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:34,562  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:524
Let me tell you something, okay?

198
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:39,283  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:524
When I watch you do a scene, I'm
thinking, "She is a great actress. "

199
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:43,969  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
But I'm also thinking, "She is hot. "

200
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:48,083  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:524
You think I'm hot?

201
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:51,090  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
You own the room.

202
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,369  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
We should probably get the... .

203
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,682  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...

204
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:07,691  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:524
So when Jessica kisses a man...

205
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,212  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
...she usually puts...

206
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,205  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:488 Y2:524
...both her hands on the man's face.

207
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,807  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

208
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:20,283  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.

209
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,889  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to try it?

210
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,083  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, okay.

211
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:42,286  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
That was good. That was really good.

212
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:49,091  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
But I think that maybe your hands
are just a little off. They should...

213
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:59,082  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, I feel like a snack.

214
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,802  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.

215
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:07,251  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
from my Scottish heritage.

216
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,925  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

217
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:13,406  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, it's just that my entire family
was run out of Scotland by...

218
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:16,051  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:524
...Vikings.

219
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:21,488  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:524
It sounds like your family's ready
to rediscover its Scottish roots.

220
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,131  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't play bagpipes
at the wedding!

221
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,686  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
How did you know?

222
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:31,608  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:446 Y2:524
- We heard you play from our apartment.
- Were you the ones who called the cops?

223
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,087  X1:098 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's not really important right now.

224
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,682  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
What is important is, while we
appreciate the gesture...

225
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:42,885  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
...we just don't feel that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

226
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,124  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why not?
- Because we hate them.

227
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:50,287  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just give me a chance to perform for
you, then decide whatever you want.

228
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:53,842  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not gonna tell you what song
I'm gonna play, either.

229
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:55,844  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let's just say when it's over...

230
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,801  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
...I'll bet there'll be
a wee bit o' celebration.

231
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,370  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, hey!

232
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:11,564  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
Who is it?

233
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,362  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's Tom.
I'm here to pick up the phone.

234
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,487  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why do you get to answer the door?

235
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:21,200  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's my apartment.

236
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,408  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
Then I get to give him the phone.

237
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:26,962  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay. Good luck explaining
all the calls to China.

238
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:30,966  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hi.

239
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,207  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, how long were we arguing for?

240
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,608  X1:084 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're not the man who left the phone.

241
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:47,003  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:524
- No, that's my assistant.
- Is he coming?

242
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:49,120  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

243
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,045  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Could you give us one second?
- Sure.

244
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,408  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'll be right back, sir.

245
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:59,009  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

246
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,611  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you believe this?

247
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:03,889  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
We were waiting for a hot guy
and a hotter one shows up.

248
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,406  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know...

249
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,650  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

250
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:11,841  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
Rachel, listen...

251
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:15,971  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
...if you let me have him,
then I will really owe you one.

252
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,523  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right.

253
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,527  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, I will let you have him.

254
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,763  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
But you owe me. You owe me big.

255
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,286  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
Which one of you will I
take to dinner?

256
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,602  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

257
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,361  X1:309 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
<i>Nice. </i>

258
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:46,043  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, you certainly own that room.

259
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,926  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:524
Actually, I rent the whole place.
I just got what you meant. Thank you.

260
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,361  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hey.

261
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,331  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

262
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:01,325  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

263
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:05,687  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

264
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:09,049  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

265
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,520  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's nice to know...

266
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,091  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica!

267
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:16,042  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's my roommate, Rachel.

268
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,169  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:524
That explains the women's underwear.

269
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,925  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

270
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:23,650  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, my God, it's true!

271
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,004  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can I just ask you to do me
just one favor?

272
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:30,605  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:484 Y2:524
Certainly.

273
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:33,526  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
Would you slap me
right here in the face?

274
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:38,966  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd love to, but my lawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

275
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,450  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, here we go.

276
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:44,688  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, wait. Just one moment.

277
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:49,682  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You're a stupid bitch.
- I really can't slap you.

278
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:53,682  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:524
- My God, you're great.
- Thanks for stopping by.

279
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,682  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I am so sorry about that.
- Oh, no.

280
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:00,651  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

281
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,245  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my God.
- What?

282
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,285  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

283
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:08,602  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:450 Y2:524
- They don't?
- I'm in a coma.

284
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,207  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
This must mean I have lines.

285
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:14,006  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

286
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,003  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
How does it happen?

287
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:24,401  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
You get thrown from a horse
into an electric fence.

288
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:28,328  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:524
A what? Jessica hates horses.

289
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:32,406  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
After this she's not gonna be crazy
about electricity, either.

290
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:40,522  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:524
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
was brilliant, Fredrick.

291
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:43,240  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
And the electric fence, inspired.

292
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:44,811  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you, sweetheart.

293
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,121  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't believe she's really gone.

294
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:51,126  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look around you. All of this is ours.

295
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:53,010  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't think so.

296
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,207  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who are you?

297
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,204  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:486 Y2:524
What's the matter, Dina?

298
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,006  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't you recognize your own...

299
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,611  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
...mother?

300
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:11,006  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>Cut! That was great, everybody. </i>
<i>Thank you. </i>

301
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,607  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:488 Y2:524
That was so wonderful!

302
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:17,009  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

303
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,925  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, no.
- Of course not, but you were good.

304
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,241  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Thanks.

305
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,562  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
Good news. I got another job.

306
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:26,087  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?

307
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,402  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
A film in Guadalajara.

308
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,005  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:524
The airport?

309
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:34,445  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, that's LaGuardia.

310
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,249  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:524
- This is Mexico.
- Oh, wow.

311
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,642  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, how long will you be gone?

312
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,610  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:524
Eight months.

313
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:50,007  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's a really long time.
- Yeah, but you could come and visit.

314
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:54,285  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
I bet you could own
a few places down there.

315
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:59,011  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, you know, I should probably
buy a place in the city first.

316
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:03,406  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
And I just got what you meant.
That is...

317
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,802  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's a tricky one.
- It's tricky.

318
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:10,761  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
Good luck.

319
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,125  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
You too.

320
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:31,124  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, remember, I'm still learning.

321
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,846  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:524
One, two, three, four!

322
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,287  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:093
You know this song. Sing along.

323
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:20,041  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:052 Y2:088
So?

324
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,881  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:052 Y2:088
No!
