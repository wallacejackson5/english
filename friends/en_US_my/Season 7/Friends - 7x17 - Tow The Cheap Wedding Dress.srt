00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:11,160  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
The caterer sent me this list of 12
appetizers. I have to narrow it to 6.

2
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:13,408  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
Food? Oh, give me.

3
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:18,686  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:524
Did Monica mention we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to play the wedding?

4
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,450  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're into swing music?

5
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:24,122  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
I used to go all over town
listening to bands.

6
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:27,529  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Chandler?
- Gap commercial.

7
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:32,762  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did you book them? Did you call?
- I will.

8
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:37,085  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You want me to call?
- I'll do it. You stick to your job.

9
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:40,125  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What is your job?
- Staying out of the way.

10
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:44,960  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is impossible.
Why don't you just pick all 15?

11
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,648  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
- There were only 12.
- Oh, yeah, I added 3.

12
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:51,366  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
What are "peanut-butter fingers"?

13
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:59,842  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:484 Y2:524
The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress

15
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:42,162  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, hello.

16
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:44,090  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
She's cute.

17
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,362  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:093
Should we go talk to her?

18
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:51,561  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:052 Y2:132
Sure. Being engaged, I'm not nervous
to talk to pretty girls anymore.

19
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:53,728  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could you guys help me?

20
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,722  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:052 Y2:093
Yeah, let me get that for you.

21
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:02,607  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:052 Y2:132
- It's really heavy.
- I got it.

22
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:10,129  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:052 Y2:132
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend, Chandler.

23
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:13,930  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:052 Y2:089
I'm Kristen.

24
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:16,441  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:052 Y2:093
Hi. Are you new to the area?

25
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:19,570  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:052 Y2:127
I'd love to show you
around sometime.

26
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,128  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:524
I actually just moved
from four blocks over.

27
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:25,766  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:052 Y2:088
But this block is like another world.

28
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:29,800  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:052 Y2:131
Actually, it does have
a very interesting history.

29
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:35,251  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:052 Y2:131
This street is the first in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

30
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,447  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:093
Before that, sewage and waste...

31
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,764  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:052 Y2:131
...would just flow
right down the street.

32
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:44,532  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:052 Y2:093
Sometimes ankle-deep.

33
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,125  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
Smooth.

34
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:50,524  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:524
Excuse me?

35
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:58,286  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:052 Y2:132
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner?

36
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,164  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'd like that.
- Great.

37
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:01,566  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Let me take this up.

38
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:04,923  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:052 Y2:131
- After you.
- Oh, no. After you.

39
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,324  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

40
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:19,129  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?

41
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:24,570  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

42
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,923  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:450 Y2:524
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!

43
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,929  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:486 Y2:524
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

44
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,322  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe I found it.

45
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:39,009  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

46
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:42,523  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.

47
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,051  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm Megan Bailey.

48
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:47,767  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Have you found your dress?
- These dresses are amazing...

49
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:51,448  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
...but I couldn't afford one.
- I can't either.

50
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:56,322  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm here to figure out the one I want,
then I'll get it at Kleinman's.

51
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,642  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're having a huge sale.

52
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:02,049  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thanks for the tip.
- When are you getting married?

53
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:07,127  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm not. I just like to try them on.
- I do the same thing.

54
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,641  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married July 25th.

55
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:14,562  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just kidding too.

56
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,326  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm getting married in December.

57
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,606  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- When are you getting married?
- May 15th.

58
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:24,320  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's close.
Who's your photographer?

59
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,244  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Jeffrey.
- We met with him.

60
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:31,327  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did he show you nude wedding photos?
- The Best Man? Wow!

61
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:34,565  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
I know.
I almost called off my wedding.

62
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:38,202  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Who's your band?
- My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.

63
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:42,371  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're lucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metal band, Carcass.

64
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:47,282  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:524
Is that spelled with a "C" or a "K"?
It doesn't matter, they're both great!

65
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:50,968  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, don't buy that here.

66
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:54,642  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
Now that you know what you want,
go to Kleinman's.

67
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:56,928  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
This place is so overpriced.

68
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,963  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
I own this store.

69
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:03,928  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:524
So does this come
in another color, or... .

70
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:16,209  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

71
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:18,323  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Moving in.
- Can I help out?

72
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:23,208  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, but be careful. The guy who was
helping before hurt his back.

73
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,684  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Boyfriend?
- No.

74
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,530  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm Joey.

75
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:29,161  X1:294 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
Kristen.

76
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:32,125  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:524
What a beautiful name.

77
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,923  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:524
What is it again?

78
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,530  X1:294 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
Kristen.

79
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:41,531  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You live around here?
- Right down there.

80
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,524  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
Let me give you a tip.

81
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:48,323  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You could wake up without shoes.

82
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,731  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'll remember that.

83
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:55,409  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
Listen, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

84
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,649  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:524
I have plans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

85
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,320  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sounds great.
Well, where does this go?

86
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:05,127  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
You look strong.
Why don't you grab one of the boxes.

87
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:11,967  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I'll get this one.

88
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,328  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
So this is Brooklyn?

89
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:27,448  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
Listen up. There's only
one dress in each size.

90
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:30,968  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

91
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:35,888  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
This is what you're looking for.
Memorize it.

92
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:41,004  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:446 Y2:524
When you locate the dress,
blow on these, all right?

93
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:46,130  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Three sharp blasts.
When you hear it, come running.

94
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:48,242  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:524
Here he comes!

95
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,609  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:444 Y2:524
- They're pushing!
- Don't be a baby!

96
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,201  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Out of the way!
- Let's go!

97
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,406  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:524
Rachel?! Come on!

98
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:09,727  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, not it. Not it. Not it.

99
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,328  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
Don't crowd me.

100
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:19,649  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is it! This is the dress!
It's perfect!

101
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:21,928  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, this one's taken!

102
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,724  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Megan!
- Monica!

103
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,530  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You came!
- Yeah!

104
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:30,366  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This is my dress!
- No!

105
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:34,366  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You saw me wearing it.
- And now you'll see me buying it.

106
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,682  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
You freak!

107
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,566  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
You wouldn't even know
about this place without me.

108
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:44,926  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Look, you don't want to fight me.
- Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

109
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:48,520  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Hey!

110
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:53,641  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?!

111
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:03,725  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

112
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,331  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you find the dress?

113
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,762  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
No. You gotta get me out of here.

114
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:11,322  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We've gotta get Monica.
- You hold my hand!

115
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,651  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:488 Y2:524
Excuse me! Excuse me!

116
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:19,721  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go! Go! Go!

117
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:33,202  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
How was your date the other night?

118
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:38,247  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Did you tell her about the magical
ride that starts with every flush?

119
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:44,363  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Laugh all you want, but she said
she'd like to go out again.

120
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:47,766  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
In fact, I'll go call her right now.

121
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:52,324  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I'll make sure and tell her my
friend Chandler says... .

122
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:00,566  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
Sorry I didn't stop by last
night, but I had a date.

123
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:04,845  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:444 Y2:524
When it's 1:00 in the morning and you
don't come by, that's okay.

124
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:09,722  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
It was with this really hot girl
who moved in across the street.

125
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:12,611  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Right across the street?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:15,042  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
- When did you meet her?
- Two days ago.

127
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,720  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:524
Excellent!

128
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,160  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know, Ross met somebody too.

129
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:22,646  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

130
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:24,928  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're going out again Saturday.

131
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:29,728  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I found out she's
also seeing some other guy.

132
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,323  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

133
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:38,485  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joe, what would you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

134
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:42,810  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:524
I am. I'm dating this girl
who's also seeing another guy.

135
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,088  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
But I'm not worried about it.

136
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:50,320  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
You shouldn't be. I wouldn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

137
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:54,644  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

138
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:59,365  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
So this is nice.

139
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:04,848  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
I wish I didn't have to go.
Believe me.

140
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,201  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
But I have to.

141
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:09,250  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
So, what's the name
of the girl you're dating?

142
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,926  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Kristen Leigh.
- Bye.

143
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,564  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, only one of us
can keep dating her.

144
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:27,287  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Obviously. So how do we decide?

145
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,848  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, now,
let's look at this objectively.

146
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:33,287  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:488 Y2:524
I think I should date her.

147
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:40,007  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:524
Or I'm the one who dates her.

148
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:44,650  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

149
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:47,441  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, but to go
in another direction...

150
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,967  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. This can go on for a while.

151
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:53,130  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
- We should order some food then.
- No, Joey.

152
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,048  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:524
Look, why don't we
just let her decide, okay?

153
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,965  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
We'll each go out with her
one more time.

154
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:03,680  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:488 Y2:524
And we'll see who she likes best.

155
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,927  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
That sounds fair.

156
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:10,801  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:524
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant.

157
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:14,049  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait a second.
We have to set a spending limit.

158
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:17,250  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't take her
to a fancy place like that.

159
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:21,161  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

160
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:25,763  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.

161
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:34,528  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So let's decide on a spending limit.
- Yeah.

162
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,726  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
And a slice...

163
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,969  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
...six dollars?

164
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,529  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I was thinking more like 100.
- Okay.

165
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:51,411  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:524
Can I borrow 94 dollars?

166
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:01,329  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:484 Y2:524
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

167
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:11,122  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're out of Diet Coke.

168
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:15,561  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hello?

169
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,563  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:524
What? You what?

170
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:21,530  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
You listen here, missy!

171
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:28,726  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
Megan booked The Swing Kings
on the day of our wedding...

172
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:32,322  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and said she'd only
give them back for the dress!

173
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:35,450  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:488 Y2:524
Does that mean Carcass is available?

174
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:41,329  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:450 Y2:524
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is "the" dress!

175
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:45,203  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?

176
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:49,121  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Figure out how to talk him out of it.
- How?

177
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:51,402  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're out of toilet paper!

178
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,370  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wanted to wish you good luck
on your date.

179
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:05,728  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thanks.
- What time are you meeting?

180
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,964  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:524
We have reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro at 8.

181
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:12,369  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

182
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:17,162  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I am dressed.
- Oh, well, good.

183
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,323  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
For me.

184
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:24,045  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?

185
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:26,720  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
I have an oily T-zone.

186
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:29,723  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, dude.

187
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,365  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You sent Kristen flowers?
- That's right.

188
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:40,210  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:524
You spent 100 dollars.
That's the limit. You're screwed!

189
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:45,051  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...

190
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,045  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I didn't break any rules.

191
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:50,169  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks for stopping by though.

192
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,648  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's how it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.

193
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:56,286  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

194
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:59,410  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm not surprised.
- You won't get away with this.

195
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:02,649  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You don't have much choice.
- We'll see!

196
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,362  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey! So, just a light layer?

197
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:10,132  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, just here and there.

198
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,921  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

199
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:23,009  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
Swing music is so out.

200
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:26,522  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
He's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

201
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,767  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you guys talking about?

202
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,361  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're talking about The Swing Kings...

203
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:35,206  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and whether they're
the right way to go.

204
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:38,722  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
I went to a wedding
where they had swing music...

205
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:41,526  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:446 Y2:524
...two months later
the couple divorced.

206
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:44,963  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

207
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,409  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but they did say
that's why they got divorced.

208
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:51,650  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:524
But I love swing music!

209
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:53,444  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
But The Swing Kings?

210
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:58,846  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
They suck so much that people die at
their concerts. They stop living.

211
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:02,763  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:524
When Monica and I went to see them,
we had fun.

212
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:04,650  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:488 Y2:524
And there's another reason.

213
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:08,970  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Well, what is the other reason?
- I don't want to say.

214
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:12,608  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, you have to,
because maybe it's stupid.

215
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:18,245  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's just, while Monica and I
were dancing to them...

216
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:21,529  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:524
...it was the first time
I knew that...

217
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:26,370  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.

218
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:30,927  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, crap.

219
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:42,126  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Our table will be ready soon.
- Oh, great.

220
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:45,444  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Is your back feeling better?
- That's fine.

221
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,325  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:484 Y2:524
I guess the more muscles you have...

222
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,531  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
...the more they can
spasm out of control.

223
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:55,567  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Kristen?
- Joey!

224
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,604  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What are you doing here?
- I like this place.

225
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:06,363  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
And technically, I'm not
breaking any rules, so... .

226
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:10,645  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

227
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:13,406  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

228
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:16,724  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
I used to have a friend named Joey.

229
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,127  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't anymore.

230
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:24,370  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
Our table will be ready
in a couple minutes.

231
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:28,531  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sure! I would love
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

232
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,011  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, Joey, you look familiar.

233
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,846  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you on TV or something?

234
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:40,168  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:524
He doesn't like to talk about it...

235
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:43,688  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but he's one of the stars
of <i>Days of Our Lives. </i>

236
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:48,525  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's right. Don't you play a woman?

237
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:54,330  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:524
A woman in a man's body.

238
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:56,563  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
Much better.

239
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,610  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.

240
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:03,241  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
Have you ever been married?

241
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:05,921  X1:265 X2:449 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, I have.

242
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:08,322  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
In fact, just the other day...

243
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:12,525  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
...Kris and I talked about how
I've been married and have a son.

244
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:16,651  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Little Eric.
- That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

245
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,244  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
So you've just been married
the one time then?

246
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:28,127  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Well... .
- You've been married twice?

247
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:31,927  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes. And...

248
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:34,726  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:524
...another time after that.

249
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:39,570  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

250
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:42,770  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
Have you ever been so hungry
on a date...

251
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:47,244  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
...that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat her food?

252
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:52,723  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

253
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:59,408  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up?

254
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:04,489  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:450 Y2:524
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?

255
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:09,004  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

256
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,931  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
But he seems like
a guy who'd marry a woman...

257
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,489  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
...on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.

258
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:23,729  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

259
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,842  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:524
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

260
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,842  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:488 Y2:524
You leave Marcel out of this!

261
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:36,522  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of leather pants?

262
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:41,163  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
Have you ever locked yourself
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

263
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:43,522  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:524
Monkey-lover!

264
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,321  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:524
Where do you think we lost her?

265
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,200  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
Probably around gonorrhea.

266
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,725  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- Don't come in here!

267
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:10,647  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

268
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:13,730  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:484 Y2:524
No. We only mess around at his place.

269
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:19,322  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so could you come out here?

270
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,210  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm wearing a wedding dress.

271
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:23,050  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:524
You got a wedding dress?

272
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,722  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
- Then why can't I see it?

273
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,724  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh. I guess you can.

274
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,964  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.

275
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,244  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

276
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,730  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow. You look hideous.

277
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:46,406  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

278
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:51,322  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.

279
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,488  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why do you have to return it?

280
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,525  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Because it doesn't really fit.

281
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:58,728  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, I booked The Swing Kings.

282
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,730  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

283
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:04,526  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:524
But that dress is terrible.

284
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:08,122  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
- It makes me want to rip it off you.
- Okay.

285
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,970  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
But you can't rip it.

286
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,930  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, maybe a little.

287
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:25,086  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Guys, you want to look
at the song list for the wedding?

288
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:26,647  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:524
Guys?

289
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,922  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
I thought you'd be gone all day.

290
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:31,726  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:094
All right, what's going on?

291
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,531  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:132
I'm sorry. I should probably
leave you girls alone.

292
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:49,127  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:052 Y2:131
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes
we'll have younger-looking skin.

293
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,527  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:052 Y2:090
You know, she could use a little... .

294
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:57,767  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:052 Y2:090
Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
