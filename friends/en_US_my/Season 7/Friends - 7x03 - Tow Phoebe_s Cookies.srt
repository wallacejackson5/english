00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,805
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,650
So, what do you think?

3
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:12,002
-About what?
-What?

4
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:16,443
Are you kidding?
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

5
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:19,929
Eyes.

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,930
No, no. Your eyes! No.

7
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,771
Chandler's eyes!

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,571
I got glasses.

9
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,048
You always had glasses.

10
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,292
No, I didn't.

11
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:35,966
Are you sure?

12
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:38,852
Didn't you have a pair?

13
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:43,092
They were really round and burgundy,
and they made you look kind of. . . .

14
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,210
-Feminine.
-Yes!

15
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:46,562
No.

16
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,446
I think the glasses look great.
You look sexy.

17
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,092
-Really?
-Yeah.

18
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,329
You didn't think I wore glasses?

19
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,046
Of course.

20
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,883

22
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,129
What do you want for
an engagement gift?

23
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,329
That's okay, we're not
having a party. . .

24
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,404
. . .so you don't have to get us--

25
00:01:56,293 --> 00:02:00,206
If someone wants to give us a present,
we can't deprive them of that joy.

26
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:03,562
You should get them a
little CD player.

27
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:04,967
I already have one.

28
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:08,290
Unless someone borrowed it and
left it at the gynecologist.

29
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:14,683
Yeah, and by "someone"
she means Joey.

30
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,281
I know what I want!

31
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,206
-What we want, honey.
-No, you don't want this.

32
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:23,733
I want your grandmother's
cookie recipe.

33
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,163
You mean the chocolate chip
cookie recipe?

34
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,608
The one my grandma
made me swear on her deathbed. . .

35
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:32,413
. . .that I would never
let out of our family?

36
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:36,085
Dying people say the craziest things.

37
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:40,804
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my children.

38
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:44,327
Break my heart. Oh, all right.

39
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:47,929
I'll be the mom who makes the
world's best chocolate chip cookies.

40
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:51,290
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,652
Ahoy!

42
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,413
-How's the boat?
-I'm getting into this sailing stuff.

43
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,450
You finally took it out of the marina?

44
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,412
Why would I do that?

45
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,846
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.

46
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:07,649
If you don't sail it,
what do you do on it?

47
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,571
It's a great place to just sit. . .

48
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:13,123
. . .hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.

49
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,730
It's good that you finally
have a place to do that.

50
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,688
I could teach you to sail if you want.

51
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:23,088
-You could?
-I've been sailing my whole life.

52
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,245
When I was 1 5, my dad
bought me my own boat.

53
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,729
-Your own boat?
-He was trying to cheer me up.

54
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,525
My pony was sick.

55
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,683
-You know what I was thinking?
-What?

56
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,124
Nothing, I just like to go like this.

57
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:51,248
-What are you doing tonight?
-Do you have a lecture?

58
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:54,530
-No, why?
-Then, free as a bird. What's up?

59
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,452
My dad wants to know if you want
to play racquetball.

60
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,325
Great! Dad must like you!

61
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,171
He doesn't ask just anyone to play.

62
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,523
He didn't ask for you.
He asked for "Chauncey. "

63
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,928
I assumed he meant you.

64
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,932
Did you correct him?

65
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,607
No, I thought it would be
more fun this way.

66
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:14,322
Cool! Maybe you could
do this every week.

67
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,767
Or you could sit on the porch. . .

68
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,049
. . .and make sure no one
steals the trashcans.

69
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,683
He does that every week too.

70
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,648
Just so you know, you have to let
him win. He hates to lose.

71
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,168
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.

72
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:30,567
You're not a lefty?

73
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,571
Does anybody know me?

74
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,363
What's wrong?

75
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,844
I went to my old apartment
to get the cookie recipe. . .

76
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,442
. . .and that stupid fire burned it up!

77
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,328
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof box. . .

78
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,451
. . .and keep it at least 1 00 yards
away from the original?

79
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,407
Because I'm normal.

80
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,567
That was the one legacy
my grandmother left me.

81
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:07,486
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.

82
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,763
We have to get you
an engagement present?

83
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:11,887
Don't worry about it.

84
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,527
No one got me an engagement present.

85
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,523
I don't have the recipe, but here.

86
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,082
I wish you health
and happiness.

87
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,731
An old cookie?

88
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:27,328
This is what happens when you
don't register for gifts.

89
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:33,089
I made a batch and froze it.
This is the only one left.

90
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,487
We can't accept this.

91
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:35,648
Why not?

92
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,529
Cause it's gross.

93
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,330
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.

94
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,171
I do this at work all the time.

95
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,482
-Really?
-I think so!

96
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,045
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

97
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,528
Two! I've been engaged twice.

98
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:04,562
Look at this clown.

99
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,930
He thinks he can take up the
whole river.

100
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,733
Get out of the way, jackass!

101
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,973
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

102
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,211
That is the Coast Guard.

103
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,448
What are they doing here?

104
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,763
The coast is all the way over there.

105
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,046
Joey, just ignore the boats.

106
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,403
-We're not finished with our lesson.
-All right.

107
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,729
I'm gonna go over the basic
points once more.

108
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,850
Come on, Rach. I got it, okay?

109
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,731
I want to go over there. . .

110
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,128
. . .where that boatload of girls is.

111
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,009
Is that it? You want to give. . .

112
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,124
. . .a shout to the hot chicas?

113
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,244
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.

114
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:47,485
Quick question, though:
What's this called?

115
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,770
-Boat rope?
-Wrong!

116
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:53,725
How do you get the mainsail up?

117
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,530
Rub it?

118
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:02,923
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?

119
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,926
I say, "Come again?"

120
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,051
I know this one. I know this one.

121
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:11,925
Time's up. Now you're dead.

122
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,322
And deaf!

123
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,410
You go on and make your little jokes.

124
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,046
If you don't know
what you're doing. . .

125
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:20,410
. . .you will die.
Am I getting through to you?

126
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,371
-Yes.
-Don't just say yes.

127
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,962
This isn't a game.
You could get hurt out here!

128
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,886
Do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?

129
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:34,732
I want to make a
ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

130
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,486
-I definitely taste nutmeg.
-You do?

131
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:49,048
You don't? Well, that's
the difference. . .

132
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:51,323
. . .between a
professional and a layman.

133
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,571
That and arrogance.

134
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,642
Hey.

135
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,332
Hey. How was sailing?

136
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,924
I don't want to talk about it.

137
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:04,723
You could've at least saved
me a cookie.

138
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,526
Women are mean!

139
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,242
I can't believe that.

140
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,684
Now the only thing left
of my grandmother's legacy is. . .

141
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,372
. . .this crumb.

142
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,966
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

143
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,651
-Hey.
-How was it?

144
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,321
Well, I had a great time.

145
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,803
Chauncey on the other hand. . . .

146
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:37,924
I will tell the story.

147
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:41,131
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding. . .

148
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,125
. . .he even said I could call him Dad.

149
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,045
And what did he ask you
not to call him?

150
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,362
"Daddy. "

151
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,370
Look, here's the story.

152
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:55,525
We hadjust finished playing,
and we were gonna take a steam.

153
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:56,762
I walk into the room...

154
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:58,929
...and it's really steamy.

155
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,450
So I take off my glasses,
and that's when it happened.

156
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:05,642
Guys?

157
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,646
-Over here.
-Have a seat, son.

158
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:14,643
Hey!

159
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:27,566
-Oh, my God! I can't believe it.
-I know.

160
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:30,128
You gave my father a lap dance.

161
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,847
Why do they put
so much steam in there?

162
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,884
Because otherwise they'd
have to call it the "room" room.

163
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,246
Why?
Why did that have to happen?

164
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,571
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

165
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:52,048
Not that big a deal?

166
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:54,568
There was touching of things.

167
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,843
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad. . .

168
00:09:57,053 --> 00:10:00,090
. . .but did you have to bond
to that part?

169
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,891
I'm sure Dad doesn't care.

170
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,566
He probably thought it was funny.

171
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,485
He'll be telling this story for years.

172
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,366
I don't want him to tell
this story for years.

173
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,848
Oh, but he will.

174
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:18,566
He still tells the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

175
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,402
I wasn't escaping.

176
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,763
Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?

177
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,531
I was trying to help out a squirrel.

178
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,451
You were trying to eat it.

179
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,372
If that is your father calling
to tell this story. . .

180
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,245
. . .then the marriage is off!

181
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,724
Come on. Hello.

182
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:41,643
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

183
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,724
I'll call you later, Dad.
I love you.

184
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,652
I'm off to see your dad.

185
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,806
Aren't you a little overdressed?

186
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:59,049
You better make sure
he tips you this time.

187
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,244
I figured I would try to convince
him not to tell the story anymore. . .

188
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:06,246
. . .and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.

189
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,882
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.

190
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,852
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.

191
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,206
Are you getting Monica and
Chandler a present?

192
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,688
I don't know. You know,
they didn't get us anything.

193
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,451
Thank you!

194
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:24,448
Hey.

195
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,127
Well, hello.

196
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,086
So when are we getting
back out on the water, matey?

197
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:33,330
I don't know the boat way
to say this, but, never.

198
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:36,162
Why not?

199
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,648
Because you're mean on the boat.

200
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,005
I was just trying to teach you.

201
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:43,522
Well, lesson learned.
Rachel is mean.

202
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,445
Yep, yep, yep.

203
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,569
I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.

204
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,610
She wouldn't let me help at all.

205
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,690
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.

206
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,048
But you couldn't move. . .

207
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:59,126
. . .because you were wearing
three life jackets.

208
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,052
You have to respect the sea.

209
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,093
Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.

210
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,289
But I tell you, that was not mean.

211
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:13,242
My father is mean. He used to always
yell at me on the boat.

212
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:16,451
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.

213
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,406
Does a good teacher say,
"Put down the beer, pinhead! "

214
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,489
Does a good student drink 7 beers
during his first lesson?

215
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:25,162
Six and a half.

216
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,570
You knocked the last
one out of my hand, remember?

217
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,604
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.

218
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,087
Well, it hit me anyway.

219
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,370
It would have hurt a lot less
if I had finished that last beer.

220
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:40,248
I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
and stop yelling.

221
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,252
No bossing me around?

222
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,165
-I won't boss you around.
-And be nice?

223
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,965
-I'll be nice.
-You'll be topless?

224
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,402
-Joey!
-You want me to learn?

225
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,442
Here's batch 22.
Maybe these are like your grandma's.

226
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,446
This has a bit of orange peel,
but no nutmeg.

227
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,251
Let's give it a shot.

228
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,082
I haven't made so many cookies
since 9th grade.

229
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,806
What for, a bake sale?

230
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,844
No, just a Friday night.

231
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,521
These are pretty good.

232
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,564
Yeah, but not as good as batch 1 7.

233
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,762
Which one was that?

234
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,009
The ones we had after
you almost threw up.

235
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,049
Oh, yeah, batch 1 7 was good.

236
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:28,251
I did not like batch 1 6.

237
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,251
I'm okay.

238
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:35,524
Any more from the good batch?
We could work off those.

239
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:39,043
I think there's one left.

240
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:46,649
Batch 1 6.
Sixteen, people, get out of the way!

241
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,442
Okay, Joey. You're doing really good.

242
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,723
I just need you
to step to the portside.

243
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,242
Remember talking about the portside?

244
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:08,932
Oh, yeah.

245
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,248
No.

246
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:15,408
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.

247
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:16,966
Why not just say left?

248
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,845
Okay, go to the left.

249
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,932
The left.

250
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,122
Just sit over there!

251
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,403
You're yelling again. See that?

252
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:32,401
Oh, no, no. Very quiet.
Said with love, no yelling.

253
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,569
You know what?

254
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:39,249
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have
a beer on the portside.

255
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,125
See what I did there?

256
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:48,611
We're luffing a little.
Can you tighten up the Cunningham?

257
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,728
You just said a bunch
of stuff I don't know.

258
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,527
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.

259
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:57,604
We did that when that bird. . .

260
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,809
. . .flew over with the fish
in his mouth.

261
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,645
Did you see it? It was gross.

262
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:03,844
I did not see the bird or the fish!

263
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:07,005
I did not see the piece of
Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!

264
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:12,249
I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to sail a boat.

265
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,166
Which obviously is
an impossible thing to do.

266
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,331
You're yelling, and I don't
see you taking your top off.

267
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,006
I quit!

268
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:23,885
-What do you mean? You can't quit.
-Why not?

269
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,891
You're not finished! I won't have it.
Greenes do not quit.

270
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,405
Greenes?

271
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:32,605
I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.

272
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:36,922
Oh, my God.

273
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:40,006
I just said, "Greenes don't quit,"
didn't l?

274
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,441
Did I say, "Greenes don't quit"?

275
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,565
Yes! And you're still yelling at me.

276
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:47,606
No, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just yelling near you.

277
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,610
Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father.

278
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,413
Oh, my God. This is horrible.

279
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:57,202
I try so hard not to be my mother,
I didn't see this coming.

280
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:04,611
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to learn.

281
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:10,612
I did learn.

282
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:14,089
-Really?
-Yeah, come on.

283
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:15,772
It's okay.

284
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,804
I know what a mainsail is.

285
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:22,207
I know to duck when
the boom comes across.

286
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:25,372
-I know port is right.
-Left.

287
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,801
Damn it!

288
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,288
It would make my grandmother happy. . .

289
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,291
. . .that we're trying
to figure out her recipe.

290
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:39,811
I bet she's looking up at us
and smiling right now.

291
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,085
Looking up?

292
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,730
She was really nice to me but
she's in hell for sure.

293
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,562
Well, I've tried everything.

294
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,451
I give up.
I'm not gonna be the mom. . .

295
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,285
. . .who makes the world's
best cookies.

296
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:59,483
I do make the best
duck confit with broccoli raab.

297
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:00,848
Kids love that, right?

298
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,291
Isn't there any relative
that has the recipe?

299
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,932
What about your sister?

300
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,852
No. I made a promise to
myself that the next time. . .

301
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:14,045
. . .I would talk to Ursula
is over my dead body.

302
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:19,850
And that's not happening
till October 1 5, 2032.

303
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:22,243
That's the day you're gonna die?

304
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,484
I've got shuffleboard that day.

305
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:26,968
That's what you think.

306
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,886
What about friends of your grandma?

307
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,202
Wouldn't they have the recipe?

308
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:38,326
I may have relatives in France
who would know.

309
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:43,402
My grandmother said she got it from
her grandmother, "Nestley Toulouse. "

310
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:46,169
What was her name?

311
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:49,453
Nestley Toulouse.

312
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,443
Nestlé Tollhouse?

313
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:01,053
You Americans always butcher
the French language.

314
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:05,322
Phoebe, is this the recipe?

315
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,052
Yes!

316
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,168
Oh.

317
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,451
I cannot believe that I spent. . .

318
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,689
. . .two days figuring out that recipe.

319
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,286
It was here the whole time!

320
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:23,247
I know! You see,
it is stuff like this. . .

321
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,848
. . .which is why
you're burning in hell!

322
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:30,963
So you understand.

323
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:33,641
I'd feel better if you
didn't tell what happened.

324
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:36,572
I'm a little embarrassed about it.

325
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,644
I understand completely.

326
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,282
Nothing's scarier
than embarrassing yourself. . .

327
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,443
. . .in front of your in-laws.

328
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:46,732
As a matter of fact, when I started
dating Judy, I was unemployed.

329
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,128
Her father asked me
what I did for a living.

330
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,051
I said I was a lawyer.

331
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:53,603
-What'd you do when they found out?
-They never did.

332
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:57,442
So if you ever see me giving them
legal advice, just nod along.

333
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,047
Shall we?

334
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,252
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

335
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,930
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it. . .

336
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,567
. . .your way of sailing
is a lot more fun.

337
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,165
Why don't you give a pull
on that rope?

338
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,448
We're not sailing.

339
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:44,730
-Just pull on it.
-All right.

340
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,926
Sandwiches!

341
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,646
What else?

342
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,086
Here you go.

343
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:57,364
-Thank you.
