1
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:03,442  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:03,652 --> 00:00:06,928  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:523
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,771  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can this count as her "something new"?

4
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:11,971  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:17,801  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you think
this is why he took off?

6
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:22,125  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
She had to have just taken it.
I took out the trash last night.

7
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:24,721  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's turning into
the worst wedding ever.

8
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:29,244  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
The bride's pregnant, the groom's
missing and I'm holding this.

9
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:34,683  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe, we cannot tell
anyone about this.

10
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:36,848  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay?

11
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:40,368  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:523
Do you know what kind
of birth control she uses?

12
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:41,567  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:523
No. Why?

13
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:45,646  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just for the future.
This is hardly a commercial for it.

14
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:49,807  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:054 Y2:132
The One With Monica
and Chandler's Wedding

15
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,808  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:054 Y2:094
Anything?

16
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:10,283  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:054 Y2:127
No. I talked to Joey.
He hasn't heard from him.

17
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:13,000  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:054 Y2:095
I talked to Chandler's parents again.

18
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:15,123  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:054 Y2:127
- You said he was missing?
- No.

19
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:17,408  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:054 Y2:089
It seemed like I called to chat.

20
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:20,644  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:127
Pretty sure they both think
I'm interested.

21
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:23,207  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:523
- We've got to tell her.
- No, we can't.

22
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:25,602  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
She'll start getting ready soon.

23
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:29,930  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:054 Y2:133
Can't you stall her? I'll go
to the places I went last night.

24
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,360  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
How much time?

25
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:34,166  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:054 Y2:094
How long before she has to get ready?

26
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:35,851  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:450 Y2:523
- One hour.
- Give me two.

27
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,088  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then why do you ask?

28
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,767  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:054 Y2:132
- Wish me luck.
- I'm going with you.

29
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,451  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why?

30
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:47,531  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:054 Y2:133
You're tired. You looked all night.
And clearly, you suck at this.

31
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:49,887  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:054 Y2:094
See you later.

32
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:51,770  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:054 Y2:132
Wait, do you know how
you're gonna stall her?

33
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:55,123  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'll figure something out.
- Okay, good luck.

34
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:00,724  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:133
Let's start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

35
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:04,641  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:054 Y2:132
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to talk to me.

36
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,564  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:054 Y2:089
About what?

37
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:12,367  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm never gonna get married!

38
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:15,405  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
You will. The right
guy's around the corner.

39
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,768  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, are we done with that?

40
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:20,170  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I'm serious.

41
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:25,400  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.

42
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,490  X1:076 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:523
Any woman would be lucky to have you.

43
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,725  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe I'd feel better
if I slept with Joey.

44
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,730  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rachel? Are you okay?

45
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:43,482  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Excuse me, Aaron? I have
a little problem with the schedule.

46
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:48,322  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

47
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:51,291  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's my best friend's,
and I'm officiating...

48
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:53,369  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
...so I really can't work past 4.

49
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:57,685  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
You've gotta stay until the end.
We can't stop filming just for you.

50
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:00,531  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's not like it's your wedding.

51
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,643  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm having surgery.

52
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:05,040  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

53
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,165  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
I made up the wedding,
because I didn't want you to worry.

54
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,448  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I'm having surgery today.

55
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:13,210  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:523
What kind of surgery?

56
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,128  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Transplant.

57
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,722  X1:097 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're supposed to work on Monday.

58
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,772  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hair transplant.

59
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:25,043  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
But you're not bald.

60
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,487  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's not on my head.

61
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:35,488  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
There's nothing I can do.
You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.

62
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:39,964  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
We've got one scene. It's just you
and Richard, and he's a pro.

63
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:42,163  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:486 Y2:523
You'll be fine.

64
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:43,966  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
Morning, Richard.

65
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:47,090  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, you're here! Great!
Let's go, buddy!

66
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,562  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
We got a scene to shoot!

67
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:53,762  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm wearing two belts.

68
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:58,322  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Are you drunk?
- No.

69
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:00,250  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes, you are!

70
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:01,971  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right.

71
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:07,165  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
So this is your office?

72
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,490  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I should've hid at the gym.

73
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:14,806  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What the hell are you doing?
- Panicking.

74
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:19,528  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:523
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm related to Monica.

75
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:24,131  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
- How is she?
- She doesn't know you're gone.

76
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:27,847  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

77
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,327  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

78
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:33,569  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
If I go home,
we're gonna become the Bings.

79
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,450  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't be the Bings.

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,091  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's wrong with it?

81
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,203  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
The Bings have bad marriages.

82
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,006  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
They yell, fight,
and use the pool boy...

83
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,527  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
...as a pawn in their sexual games.

84
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:50,082  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Have you ever put on a black dress
and asked me up to your hotel room?

85
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,410  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
- No.
- Then you are neither of your parents.

86
00:04:56,012 --> 00:05:00,210  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

87
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:03,324  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
Only Paul Newman
can make marriage work.

88
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:05,329  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I am no Paul Newman.

89
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:10,327  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

90
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,331  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:486 Y2:523
But look, Chandler...

91
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:17,927  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
...right now no one has
a lower opinion of you than I do.

92
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:21,480  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I totally believe you can do this.

93
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:25,806  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:523
I want to. I love her so much,
but I'm afraid...

94
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:27,646  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's too huge.

95
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,803  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're right. It is huge.

96
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,408  X1:183 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
So let's take it
just a little bit at a time.

97
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:36,610  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Forget getting married for a sec.

98
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:40,646  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:523
Can you just come home
and take a shower?

99
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,808  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's not scary, right?

100
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,480  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Depends on what you mean by "we. "

101
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,682  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
The nights are the hardest.

102
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:53,968  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
But then the day comes...

103
00:05:54,212 --> 00:05:58,125  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and that's every bit
as hard as the night.

104
00:05:58,332 --> 00:06:02,166  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Then the night comes...
- Days and nights are hard, I get it!

105
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:06,166  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

106
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:09,051  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know. At dusk.

107
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,846  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's such a hard time for me.

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,887  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm gonna put makeup on.
We have to be there in an hour.

109
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:17,406  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Wait!
- What?

110
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,728  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let's go to lunch!

111
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:22,082  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't go to lunch!

112
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,970  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Right.

113
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:28,247  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.

114
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,443  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's going on?

115
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:36,570  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, honey, listen.

116
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:42,124  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
When I tell you what I'm
about to tell you, remember...

117
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:45,762  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that we're all here for you,
and we love you.

118
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,645  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, you're really freaking me out.

119
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:52,242  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:523
We can't find Chandler...

120
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,050  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:488 Y2:523
His vest.

121
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:57,808  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:486 Y2:523
We can't find Chandler's vest.

122
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:00,606  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
How can that be?
Wait, are you serious?

123
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:03,367  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Found the vest.

124
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:07,963  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
We'll have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't lose it again.

125
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:12,047  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, wow! Okay, don't
scare me like that, okay?

126
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:16,530  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:444 Y2:523
For a minute, I was like,
"Oh, my God! The worst has happened! "

127
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,441  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
So you two were married, huh?

128
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:36,690  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
What happened, you just drift apart?

129
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:40,492  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here comes the bride.

130
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,922  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, Monica!

131
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,800  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want to wear this every day.

132
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,968  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:488 Y2:523
You look so beautiful.

133
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,931  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so happy for me.

134
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,724  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hello?
- Did Chandler show up yet?

135
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:04,288  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
- We got him back. Everything's fine.
- Damn it!

136
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:06,926  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Where are you?
- I'm still on the set.

137
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:10,090  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
The wedding is in less than an hour.

138
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:14,888  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't let me go until we get it.

139
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:18,528  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

140
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,246  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I'm the minister!

141
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:25,405  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Put them both on the phone
and I'll marry them right now.

142
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:26,971  X1:218 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey, I have to go.

143
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:31,927  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you
and me right now! I have the power!

144
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:37,764  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
There you go! You put on a tuxedo!

145
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,283  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
That wasn't scary, was it?

146
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:42,724  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

147
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:45,844  X1:183 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm telling you,
just a little bit at a time.

148
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:48,971  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. What's the next little bit?

149
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,123  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:523
Getting married.

150
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:56,042  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
You can do that too.
Just like you've done everything else.

151
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,122  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.

152
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:05,361  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Where you going?

153
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:09,048  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not gonna run away.
I just want some fresh air.

154
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:11,528  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Okay.
- Okay.

155
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,126  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, fresh air!

156
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:27,851  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Cover for me.
- Maybe you overreacted. You do that.

157
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,764  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
We gotta do something.

158
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:34,369  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey won't make it, so I'll
look around for other weddings.

159
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:38,844  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't tell them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

160
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,320  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

161
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:54,963  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:523
Anastassakis Papasifakis Wedding.
Excellent.

162
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,643  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations.

163
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:02,849  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi! Oh, great hat.

164
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,761  X1:084 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

165
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,770  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't know.
Are they Greek Orthodox?

166
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:12,485  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:17,044  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
They're my friends,
Monica Stephanopolis.

168
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:21,365  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
And Chandler Acidophilus.

169
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:35,689  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
Has anyone seen Chandler?

170
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:38,770  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I thought he was with you.
- He was with me.

171
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,606  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're playing a game. Hide-and-seek.

172
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:44,565  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
You can't ask us, son.
That's cheating.

173
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:52,727  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

174
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:56,561  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
He can't come here and see
the bride in her wedding dress.

175
00:10:56,772 --> 00:11:00,890  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
When we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

176
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:05,043  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad luck then.

177
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,322  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, it isn't good luck.

178
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:14,484  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God! Monica.

179
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,364  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know!

180
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:20,648  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
- How's Chandler doing?
- Great.

181
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:24,811  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about Chandler.

182
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:29,368  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,847  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What's going on?
- Chandler's gone again.

184
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:42,291  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why would you play hide-and-seek with
someone you know is a flight risk?

185
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:49,482  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Aaron, you gotta let me go.
The guy's hammered.

186
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:54,402  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm sorry. As long as he's here
and conscious, we're still shooting.

187
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:07,006  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
You wouldn't happen to have
a very big fork?

188
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:11,126  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, I just talked to the director.

189
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:14,051  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's it. We're done for the day.

190
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,530  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
We finished the scene?

191
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:21,201  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You were wonderful.
- As were you.

192
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,048  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
So I got your car.
It's right outside.

193
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:27,130  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you. You're welcome.

194
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:31,286  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, we gotta go. Come on.
Here we go.

195
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,882  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is that my ass?

196
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:44,292  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:523
- There he is!
- What?

197
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:48,163  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
You won't get away this time!

198
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:51,409  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Unless you want
that ass-kicking we talked about!

199
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,244  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ross!

200
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:00,287  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm serious! You're not
walking out on my sister!

201
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,130  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's right. I'm not.

202
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:05,842  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Then where have you been?
- I know about Monica.

203
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,888  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:450 Y2:523
- You know?
- What?

204
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:12,243  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I heard you and Rachel talking.
- About what?

205
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:13,521  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:486 Y2:523
You don't know?

206
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,963  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
If somebody doesn't tell me
right now... .

207
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,890  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
What, you'll "hi-yah"?

208
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:22,604  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Monica's pregnant.

209
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:26,124  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

210
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,842  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
And you're not freaking out?

211
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:33,840  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was. Then I went to the
gift shop for cigarettes.

212
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:37,203  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Cigarettes?
- Big picture, please!

213
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,890  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:523
So I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this... .

214
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,730  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I thought anything that can
fit into this can't be scary.

215
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,648  X1:200 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:523
You obviously
didn't see <i>Chuckie III. </i>

216
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,523  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:523
But come on, look at how cute
and small this is.

217
00:13:56,772 --> 00:14:01,323  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
So I got it to give Monica,
so she'd know I was okay.

218
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:02,885  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dude.

219
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,285  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
Way to go, son.
I knew you'd find him.

220
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:17,482  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
Our little boy is getting married.

221
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,490  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look at you, so handsome.

222
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,887  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:486 Y2:523
You look beautiful, Mom.

223
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,081  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:486 Y2:523
You look beautiful too, Dad.

224
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:33,288  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you both.

225
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,483  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so glad you're here.

226
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,168  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you Chandler?

227
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:45,289  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you Joey?

228
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,887  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:450 Y2:523
- This is nice.
- What?

229
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:57,489  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
I've never walked down the aisle
knowing it can't end in divorce.

230
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:15,882  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:523
I wish your grandmother
had lived to see this.

231
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:20,290  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
- She's right there.
- Not that old crone. My mother.

232
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:25,882  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations, darling.

233
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,088  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
We love you, sweetheart.

234
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,888  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:523
You look beautiful.

235
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:37,080  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Is this new?
- Not now.

236
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:43,641  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Who's this?
- I'm Father Karabasos.

237
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,570  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:486 Y2:523
He's Greek Orthodox.

238
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,081  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:523
As are you.

239
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,730  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let us begin.

240
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,006  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dearly beloved...

241
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,043  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's my line!

242
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,160  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can take it from here. Thanks.

243
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,886  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
Dearly beloved,
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

244
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:14,085  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
You may be confused by this now...

245
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:18,086  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but you won't be
Memorial Day weekend, 2002.

246
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,321  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

247
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,886  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
We are gathered here today...

248
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,481  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:523
...to join this man...

249
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:39,890  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

250
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:44,731  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
I've known Monica and Chandler
for a long time, and I can't...

251
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:49,443  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
...imagine two people more
perfect for each other.

252
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:56,289  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
And now, as I've left my notes
in my dressing room...

253
00:16:57,412 --> 00:17:00,882  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:523
...we shall proceed
to the vows. Monica?

254
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:05,089  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:450 Y2:523
- He took off?
- Go on. Go on.

255
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:14,086  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler, for so long...

256
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,087  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I wondered if I would ever
find my prince.

257
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,163  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:523
My soul mate.

258
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,091  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then three years ago,
at another wedding...

259
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:25,800  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:488 Y2:523
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

260
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:31,046  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
And instead, I found everything that
I'd been looking for my whole life.

261
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,484  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now...

262
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,284  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:523
...here we are...

263
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,487  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
...with our future before us.

264
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:45,286  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I only want to spend it with you.

265
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:50,485  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
My prince. My soul mate.

266
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,683  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:523
My friend.

267
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,681  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
Unless you don't want to.

268
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:01,485  X1:292 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:523
You go.

269
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:03,841  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler?

270
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:07,088  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, that's okay.

271
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:15,484  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought this would be the most
difficult thing I ever had to do.

272
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:21,284  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
But when I saw you walking down that
aisle, I realized it's simple.

273
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,040  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

274
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:31,886  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
Any surprises that come our way, it's
okay, because I will always love you.

275
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:38,085  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my life with.

276
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,482  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:486 Y2:523
You want to know if I'm sure?

277
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:46,650  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
You may now kiss the bride.

278
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:53,801  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the State of New York...

279
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,407  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and the Internet guys...

280
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:02,491  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:523
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

281
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,611  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

282
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,007  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I do.
- I do.

283
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,725  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, you do!

284
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,201  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rings?

285
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,084  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, crap.

286
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,484  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let's do the rings.

287
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,686  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
We good? Yeah? Good?

288
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,530  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:523
Once again...

289
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,162  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I pronounce you husband and wife.

290
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:39,482  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
Now kiss her again.

291
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:55,690  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

292
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:57,968  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I know about the baby.

293
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,768  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What baby?
- Our baby.

294
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:02,644  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
We have a baby?

295
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,481  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

296
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:08,762  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
I didn't take a pregnancy test.

297
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,724  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then who did?

298
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:13,886  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at them.

299
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,885  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
And they're gonna have a baby.
