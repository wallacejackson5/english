1
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:07,322  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:524
Do you realize we're
getting married in four weeks?

2
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:10,405  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

3
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:13,202  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
You realize you get louder each week?

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:17,568  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows?

5
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:22,129  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow. "

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,082  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to this.

7
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:32,168  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

8
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:36,004  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you happen to know
what I'm gonna say?

9
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:40,241  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

10
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:42,289  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
Say what's in your heart.

11
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:52,247  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
<i>Look at her go. She must</i>
<i>love me more than I love her! </i>

12
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:56,925  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>What's wrong with me? </i>
<i>Oh, don 't open that door. </i>

13
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,362  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One with the Vows

00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:41,923  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:052 Y2:091
"Monica, there are no words..."

16
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:47,443  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:052 Y2:126
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

17
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,326  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:052 Y2:132
You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

18
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:56,770  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:052 Y2:126
With Carol I promised never
to love another woman until I die.

19
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:58,730  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:052 Y2:093
She made no such promise.

20
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:03,969  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:132
I'm pathetic. Monica knows what
to say, you should have seen her.

21
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,450  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:052 Y2:094
What's the emergency?

22
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:12,446  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:052 Y2:126
You have to help me write my vows.
All I have is this.

23
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:16,241  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:131
I like the pretty drawing
of you in the wedding dress.

24
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:21,131  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Thank you.
- Except your breasts look small.

25
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:24,322  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:052 Y2:093
Those are my eyes!

26
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:29,487  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah.

27
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:35,329  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:052 Y2:132
Why don't you start
with something simple?

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:40,566  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:052 Y2:132
"Monica, from the moment I met you
I knew I loved you. "

29
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:42,325  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't do that.

30
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,961  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everyone, this is Chandler.

31
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:47,128  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:524
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

32
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,325  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

33
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:54,849  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, okay.
Maybe you could start with:

34
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:57,771  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

35
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,209  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
...there was a part of me
that knew I wanted more. "

36
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:05,963  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:524
All right, there's a nuclear
holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.

37
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,128  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Would you go out with me?

38
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,321  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:488 Y2:524
Are we allowed to lie in the vows?

39
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:20,924  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay, don't talk about those feelings.
Just say something about...

40
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:24,124  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
...all the things
he's taught you, like...

41
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:32,241  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
Or all the things you taught him.

42
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,766  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:524
Everybody knows the erogenous zones.
One, two, three...

43
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:41,963  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:486 Y2:524
...four, five, six and seven.

44
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,924  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:524
There are seven?

45
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,928  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's one?
- Kind of an important one.

46
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,882  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was looking at it upside down.

47
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:58,126  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know, sometimes that helps.

48
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,564  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, start out with a little one...

49
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,485  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:486 Y2:524
...a two, a one-two-three...

50
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:12,723  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:486 Y2:524
...a three, a five...

51
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:16,372  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:486 Y2:524
...a four, a three-two...

52
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:18,568  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:486 Y2:524
...two, a two-four-six.

53
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:23,008  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:486 Y2:524
Two-four-six, four, two...

54
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,726  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:486 Y2:524
...two, four-seven...

55
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,321  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:486 Y2:524
...five-seven, six-seven...

56
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:31,961  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:492 Y2:524
...seven, seven...

57
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:35,363  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:492 Y2:524
...seven, seven, seven...

58
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:36,925  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:524
...seven!

59
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:47,448  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
How about something like:

60
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:52,129  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together... . "

61
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,563  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah?
- I can't do all of it.

62
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,007  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look back over your time together.

63
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,564  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, look, twins!

64
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:09,327  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

65
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,326  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

66
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:16,167  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:524
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

67
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,971  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
...what do you say we have one?
- Why wouldn't I be married?

68
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,163  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just meant hypothetically.

69
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:27,250  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hypothetically,
why won't I be married?

70
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,521  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, no.

71
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:32,168  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
What is it? Is there
something unmarriable about me?

72
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:35,331  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well?

73
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:38,729  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

74
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,162  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm getting married today!

75
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,330  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:524
Think he knew I was here?

76
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:55,561  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nice try.

77
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,524  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wait, wait, wait.

78
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:01,527  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Look, Monica...

79
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:09,128  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this'll work.

80
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,732  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
You are so great! I love you.

81
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:30,240  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

82
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:34,041  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
I said you're so great,
and then I stopped talking.

83
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:39,284  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You said you love me!
- No, I didn't.

84
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,407  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

85
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,886  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

86
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:48,764  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop it! Stop it!

87
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:56,726  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, I was thinking,
what if I unpack here?

88
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:59,207  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:524
Then all your stuff would be here.

89
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,131  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well... .

90
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,330  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:524
What if it was here?

91
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,924  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:524
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

92
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:11,925  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
Doesn't make any sense.

93
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,925  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

94
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:19,931  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

95
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,283  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
We wanted to surprise you.

96
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,771  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

97
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,525  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler...

98
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,524  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:524
...in all my life...

99
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,932  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I never thought I'd be so lucky...

100
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:02,728  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
...as to fall in love with my best...

101
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:08,045  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
My best... There's a reason
why girls don't do this!

102
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,288  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

103
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:13,130  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought...

104
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:18,685  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can do this.

105
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,925  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought...

106
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:29,126  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

107
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:34,726  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

108
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,725  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

109
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,409  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
And if you let me...

110
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:52,128  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

111
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,245  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica?

112
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:05,565  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you marry me?

113
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,330  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

114
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,280  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can we come in?
We're dying out here!

115
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:26,925  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
Come in! Come in!

116
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:30,329  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:524
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

117
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:43,649  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

118
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:47,049  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:524
Helping Chandler write his vows.
He kicked us out.

119
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,891  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

120
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:55,521  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
How is "Monica, I love
your sweet ass" inappropriate?

121
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:58,845  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:524
How's Monica doing?

122
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:02,806  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
Lucky she's got a sweet ass.
She's not so good at writing.

123
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,845  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
In four weeks
they're gonna be married!

124
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:09,128  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let's just hope it works.

125
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,971  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

126
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,605  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's not true.

127
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,928  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're right. How's the missis?

128
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:18,807  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe...

129
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:21,242  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
...they're together 3 years.
- That long?

130
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:24,762  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
It seems like less
because they hid it from us.

131
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,326  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

132
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:37,126  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've had a very long, hard day.

133
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:41,208  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm getting some chicken. Want some?
- No. Bye, then.

134
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:49,328  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

135
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:51,766  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chicken?

136
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,530  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:524
I could eat some chicken.

137
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,331  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Joe!

138
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:03,606  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
Can I get a three-piece,
coleslaw, beans and a Coke?

139
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:05,931  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
Diet Coke.

140
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:13,931  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Why didn't they tell us?
- I know, we were cool about it.

141
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:16,925  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
You? And you?

142
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:20,087  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
You cannot tell. No one knows.

143
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,044  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:524
How? When?

144
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:24,722  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
- It happened in London.
- In London?!

145
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:30,968  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

146
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:33,322  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
But it is a big deal!

147
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:36,127  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

148
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,051  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You can't.
- Please!

149
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:42,922  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
We don't want to deal with telling
them. Just promise you won't tell.

150
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,646  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right!

151
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,564  X1:130 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>I can 't wait to be with you. </i>
<i>I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry. </i>

152
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,531  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>Laundry? Is that my new nickname? </i>

153
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,572  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>You know your nickname, Mr. Big... </i>

154
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:08,961  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

155
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,168  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler and Monica!

156
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:22,925  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

157
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:25,925  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

158
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,648  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

159
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:33,362  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:524
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

160
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:34,721  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know! I know!

161
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,166  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You know?
- Yes!

162
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,409  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
And Joey, but Ross doesn't,
so stop screaming!

163
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,322  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, hi!

164
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,166  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:524
What? What?

165
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,290  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're excited that you
might get this place!

166
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:52,885  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

167
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,731  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
Get in here! Come on!

168
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,927  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:524
So they don't know
that Rachel knows?

169
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,925  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

170
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,323  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
Enough of us know.
We can just tell them we know.

171
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:11,291  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
The lying and the secrets
will be over.

172
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:15,929  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:524
Or, we can not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

173
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,690  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:524
We better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

174
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,564  X1:311 X2:405 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Bye.
- Bye.

175
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:24,332  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

176
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:32,165  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
Did you see
the inappropriate pinching?

177
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:33,441  X1:247 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Actually, I did.

178
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,928  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

179
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,925  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God!
My God, she knows about us!

180
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,448  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Phoebe knows about us!
- I didn't tell them.

181
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:47,406  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:524
Them? Who's them?

182
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:51,046  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe and Joey.

183
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,006  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey!

184
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,566  X1:264 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:524
And Rachel.

185
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:58,645  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
They made me promise not to tell.

186
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:02,128  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

187
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:05,330  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
They don't know that we know
that they know.

188
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,523  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:446 Y2:524
- So... .
- Ah, yes!

189
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:11,525  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:488 Y2:524
The messers become the messees!

190
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:15,928  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
My God, he wants me to come
over and feel his biceps!

191
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,121  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you kidding?

192
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,721  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

193
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,760  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey? Do they know that we know?

194
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,368  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Joey!

195
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,132  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:450 Y2:524
- They know you know.
- I knew it!

196
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:40,088  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:524
I cannot believe those two!

197
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,728  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
They thought that they could
mess with us? With us?

198
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:49,442  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

199
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,563  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
Joey, you can't say anything.

200
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,603  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:488 Y2:524
Couldn't if I wanted to.

201
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:59,325  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
She wants me to put lotion on her!

202
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:00,925  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:524
She's bluffing!

203
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,930  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
She's not backing down.
She went like this.

204
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,603  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

205
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,689  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aren't you guys done yet?

206
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:18,283  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:524
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over.

207
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,331  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I like that.
- Okay.

208
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:25,123  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

209
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,721  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wow! You didn't rip off
any buttons.

210
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,485  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's not my first time.

211
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,161  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
You go seduce her until she cracks.

212
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:43,130  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, give me a second.

213
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,730  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

214
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:53,566  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, you're going?

215
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,928  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
Not without you, lover.

216
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:03,804  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, this is my bra.

217
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,323  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's very, very nice.

218
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,846  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, come here.

219
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:16,612  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm happy we're gonna
have all the sex.

220
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,404  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
You should be. I'm very bendy.

221
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:29,244  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- Not if I kiss you first.

222
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:51,490  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:524
There's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

223
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:54,129  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:488 Y2:524
Here it comes.

224
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:56,605  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
Our first kiss.

225
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:08,529  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

226
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,410  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I can't have sex.
- Why not?

227
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,251  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

228
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:20,527  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

229
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:26,730  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you, Monica.

230
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,728  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you too, Chandler.

231
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:39,005  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
I thought you guys were doing it,
I didn't know you were in love.

232
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:42,686  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

233
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:46,726  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Well, Ross doesn't.
- We'd like it if no one told him yet.

234
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,325  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

235
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,722  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing?

236
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:56,131  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
Get off my sister!

237
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,563  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
Friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

238
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,370  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
Think it'll be different?

239
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,524  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
How can it not be?
They're gonna have kids...

240
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:09,969  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

241
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,601  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
And maybe they'll leave the city...

242
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:15,531  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

243
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,810  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:524
Things change.

244
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:23,084  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

245
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:26,045  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:524
It'll be okay, Joe.

246
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:30,168  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

247
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,768  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who's this little naked guy?

248
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,968  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
That naked guy would be me.

249
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,130  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look at the little thing.

250
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,725  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

251
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:45,050  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

252
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,001  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

253
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,328  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, that's Nana right there.

254
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:53,927  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wow.
- Let's see.

255
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,692  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "

256
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:00,282  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:524
Monica, you look like your grandma.
How old was she?

257
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:02,325  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:486 Y2:524
Let's see, 1939.

258
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,523  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, 24, 25.

259
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:07,530  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
Looks like a fun gang.

260
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:16,329  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

261
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,290  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let me see.

262
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,729  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, that would be me again.

263
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,771  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, you guys.
- What's going on?

264
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:32,327  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, we were just talking about...

265
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:35,649  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

266
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:39,731  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

267
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:42,285  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's so sweet.

268
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:47,207  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So, we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

269
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:50,927  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
As long as I don't hear his
and he doesn't hear mine.

270
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,523  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, that's beautiful.

271
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,245  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
Funny one! Good!

272
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,805  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you marry me?

273
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,364  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
What? I don't get it.

274
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:14,330  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah!

275
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,406  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

276
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,126  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.

277
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,723  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:052 Y2:093
Okay, what do you think?

278
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:38,324  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Dude... .
- I have never known love like this.

279
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,566  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:052 Y2:126
- You really like it?
- Dude!

280
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,650  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:052 Y2:093
How did you write this?

281
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,320  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:132
I stole Monica's
and changed the name.

282
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:52,923  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:052 Y2:131
- You can't do that!
- Lf he goes first he can!
