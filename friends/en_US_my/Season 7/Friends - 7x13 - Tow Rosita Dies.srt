00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:05,920  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:10,125  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What are you doing?
- I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:11,651  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why would you want to do that?

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:14,161  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
So there'd be a decent place
for me to sit?

5
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:19,491  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Rach, there is a decent place.
- And your lap does not count.

6
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,852  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Come on, help me move this.
- No, no, no.

7
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,321  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No?
- No.

8
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,170  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:524
Rosita does not move.

9
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,446  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?

10
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:34,882  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:488 Y2:524
As in "Rosita does not move. "

11
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:37,168  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's just a chair.
What's the big deal?

12
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:40,682  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's the exact equal distance
from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:45,801  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and it's at an angle where you
don't get any glare coming off Stevie.

14
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,170  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
Stevie the TV?

15
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:52,249  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Is there a problem?
- No.

16
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:56,646  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:524
What does he know?

17
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:59,929  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Come on, Rosita.
Us <i>chicas</i> gotta stick together.

18
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,641  X1:276 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
You bitch!

19
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:14,562  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One Where Rosita Dies

21
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:49,207  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Ross?

22
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,761  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:088
I checked the real estate section.

23
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,647  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look at this.

24
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,524  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:052 Y2:089
Looks like Mom and Dad's house.

25
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:59,003  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:126
Even has a tree
with a broken limb out front.

26
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,927  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:052 Y2:088
And the window in the attic... .

27
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:05,288  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, my God!

28
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:08,610  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:052 Y2:126
What happened
to the window in the attic?

29
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:13,080  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:052 Y2:132
- I can't believe they're selling it.
- And they didn't tell us.

30
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:15,760  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:052 Y2:126
What happened
to the window in the attic?

31
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,649  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:052 Y2:094
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

32
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:23,168  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:132
We'll go to the store and get you
a new chair right now.

33
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,766  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
She's not even cold yet.

34
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:33,364  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:052 Y2:132
Wouldn't Rosita have
wanted you to move on?

35
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,890  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:131
I mean, you know, she did always
put your comfort first.

36
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:41,365  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:052 Y2:089
That's true.

37
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:49,287  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

38
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,245  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:524
Man, some stranger's gonna be
in my room.

39
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:55,251  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
For 15 years they kept it
as a shrine to you.

40
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,841  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's time the velvet ropes came down.

41
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,445  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
They kept your room a while.

42
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:05,043  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please! Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

43
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:09,251  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

44
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:10,771  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Not a gym.

45
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:14,842  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Come on. You know they love you.
- As much as they love you?

46
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:18,965  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
They thought she was barren
until I was born. It's not my fault.

47
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,850  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
I hate this year.

48
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:25,644  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's wrong with this year?

49
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:29,003  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's February and I've only
given two massages...

50
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:31,442  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and they were both horrible tippers.

51
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:32,926  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:524
That was me and Ross.

52
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:37,008  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, that's right.

53
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,051  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
If you want some extra cash...

54
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,682  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
...some college friends made
good money doing telemarketing.

55
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,925  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'd be better than the last
telephone job I had.

56
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:48,925  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
I probably won't have to say
"spank" as much.

57
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,531  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

58
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,652  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah, like you never called.

59
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:05,845  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is very easy.
You read from the script...

60
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,606  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and try to sell as much
toner as you can.

61
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,404  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I can do that.

62
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:13,803  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:524
By the way, I love my office.

63
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:17,010  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Why don't we do a trial run?
- Oh, okay.

64
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,406  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right.

65
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:23,412  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

66
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:27,486  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Can I speak to your supply manager?
- I'm the supply manager.

67
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,922  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd like to talk
about your toner needs.

68
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:31,008  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:524
We don't need any.

69
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:33,203  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

70
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,566  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

71
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:38,645  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. What was wrong with that call?

72
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,171  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, well, all right.

73
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:43,688  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
No offense,
but you were kind of rude.

74
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,885  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
They always say they
don't need toner. That's okay.

75
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:52,489  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whatever they say, you can find the
answer to it, here in the script.

76
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,081  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:524
So I think you're ready to sell toner.

77
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,283  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Do you have any last questions?
- No.

78
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,727  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait, yes, I do have one question:

79
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:01,451  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
What is toner?

80
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:05,885  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey?

81
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:08,881  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
Joe?

82
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,890  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:484 Y2:524
Full bag?

83
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,682  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Beer's still cold.

84
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:23,330  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Something terrible
must have happened here.

85
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,203  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no, no, no!

86
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,492  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:486 Y2:524
Stevie, I was never here.

87
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,800  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Dad?
- I'm here!

88
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,891  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hi.

89
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:51,210  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
Seems like just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

90
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,687  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:524
We can't believe
you're selling the house.

91
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,689  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:524
Time for a new family
to start here.

92
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:59,004  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
I hope their check clears before
they find the crack...

93
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:01,931  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiling.

94
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:06,525  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:524
Let's grab our stuff and
get the hell out of here.

95
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:10,328  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Sorry we can't store your things.
- Oh, it's okay.

96
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,642  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't wait to see everything again.

97
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,723  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know what's down here.

98
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:18,481  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
But there are six or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

99
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:21,408  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
I used to love to play restaurant.

100
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:24,570  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
Not as much as you loved to play
"uncooked batter eater. "

101
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,970  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't expect a child to wait
for a light bulb to cook brownies.

102
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:34,006  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
So I think your boxes are over here.

103
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,565  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, great.

104
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,410  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey...

105
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,568  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
...whose cigarettes are these?

106
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:43,523  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

107
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,047  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
They must be your mother's.

108
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:50,808  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
But please, please don't ask her.
I'll throw these away.

109
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:57,843  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Cool! Dad, my report cards!

110
00:06:58,092 --> 00:06:59,411  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, check this out.

111
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:04,606  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
Math, "A. " Science, "A. "
History, "A. " Gym... .

112
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:13,045  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
My rock polisher!

113
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,568  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Uh-oh.
- What?

114
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,888  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know how the garage
floods every spring?

115
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:24,090  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
How are you ever gonna sell
this place?

116
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:27,006  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:524
I think I accidentally
used Monica's boxes...

117
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:29,561  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

118
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:35,244  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

119
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:36,402  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
What the...

120
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:40,804  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined!

121
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,168  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

122
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:47,008  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
You don't secretly smoke, do you?

123
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:49,602  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

124
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:52,567  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
So it's just your mother then.

125
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:59,048  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

126
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,050  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can I speak to your
supply manager, please?

127
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:04,969  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
Earl. Thanks.

128
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,486  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

129
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:12,200  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

130
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,802  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't need any toner.

131
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:20,409  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
I hear what you're saying, but at
our prices, everyone needs toner.

132
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:23,126  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Not me.

133
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:25,170  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:524
May I ask why?

134
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,806  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to know why?

135
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:29,766  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to know why?

136
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:31,803  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
I surely do.

137
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:33,441  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>Okay. </i>

138
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,652  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't need any toner...

139
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,848  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
...because I'm gonna kill myself.

140
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,612  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
Is that because you're out of toner?

141
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:02,406  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

142
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,964  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up.
Just please talk to me.

143
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,561  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well... .

144
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:11,643  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
I only had one thing to do today.

145
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:17,371  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
I guess I could push it back.

146
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:20,406  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kill yourself?

147
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:24,850  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
I've been working for 10 years
now at this...

148
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:27,048  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
...meaningless, dead-end job...

149
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,250  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and nobody here
even knows that I exist.

150
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:32,851  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler?

151
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:39,208  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry?

152
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:42,051  X1:298 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look...

153
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,686  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'm sure that people know
you exist.

154
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,923  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...

155
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,571  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
...surrounded by people.

156
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:52,805  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've been talking to you for five
minutes now about killing myself...

157
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,529  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and no one's even looked up
from their desk. Hang on.

158
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:58,450  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, everybody...

159
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:00,085  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I'm gonna kill myself.

160
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:05,840  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:524
I got nothing.

161
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,564  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Good chair.

162
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,611  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
Now, if anybody asks...

163
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:15,491  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
...your name is Rosita.

164
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:40,650  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

165
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,760  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:524
Joey, the new chair
will be here in an hour.

166
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,440  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
Maybe we should move
Rosita out of here.

167
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,847  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
Start the healing process.

168
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:52,450  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I guess you're right.

169
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,968  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
She's healed!

170
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:19,928  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's weird.

171
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,525  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, it's not weird.

172
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,245  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's a miracle!

173
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:27,170  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not a miracle. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

174
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:31,411  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.

175
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:36,412  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
She'll understand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

176
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,125  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:486 Y2:524
Dad, that won't matter to her.

177
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:40,602  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.

178
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:42,251  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:524
And all her stuff is...

179
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:45,211  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
...growing new stuff.

180
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,091  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is the kind of thing...

181
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,324  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
...that makes her think
you love me more than her.

182
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,603  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
My God. Does she think that?

183
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,040  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, can you blame her?

184
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:58,482  X1:072 X2:643 Y1:450 Y2:524
We may have favored you unconsciously.
You were a marvel.

185
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:01,923  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:450 Y2:524
- The doctors said your mom couldn't...
- I don't want to hear it.

186
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,646  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Really?
- Well, not right now.

187
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:09,246  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:524
Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we'll give her some.

188
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,164  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, grab... .

189
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:14,364  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:524
Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff
from mine...

190
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:18,651  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'll put in there.

191
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,602  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:486 Y2:524
Like, this. She could have made this.

192
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:23,922  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This could have been hers.
- Sure.

193
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:31,367  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you want to tell the medical marvel
story while we work, that'd be fine.

194
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:38,248  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myself.

195
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,043  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. Me too.

196
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:51,244  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, this thing has
speakers in the headrest?

197
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:52,766  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No, really?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:55,321  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
You can hook it to the TV
and you get radio.

199
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,688  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
My chair heals itself.

200
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:07,765  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
All right. Let's just forget about
the people at the office, okay?

201
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:11,607  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's gotta be someone
worth sticking around for.

202
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:15,600  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
What about family or friends?
Maybe a girlfriend?

203
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,526  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, right.

204
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,723  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

205
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,087  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I should...

206
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:24,766  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
...be getting back to my thing now.

207
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,491  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:524
See you.

208
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,365  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!

209
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:32,168  X1:208 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
The new girl's good.

210
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,570  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:488 Y2:524
Which boxes are mine?

211
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,206  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
- These are yours right here.
- Okay.

212
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,285  X1:235 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:524
A coloring book.

213
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,085  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
You loved that thing.

214
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,931  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:524
You never went anywhere without...

215
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,969  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:524
...without that coloring book.

216
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,287  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

217
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,046  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
Looks like I had trouble
staying in the lines.

218
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,685  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Nuh-uh!

219
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,287  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wow, look at this.

220
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:59,251  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:524
I can't believe I even
fit into this shirt.

221
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:04,926  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, this is yours.

222
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,845  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't know how that got in there.

223
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,563  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

224
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:14,969  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, these are your boxes.

225
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:20,044  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
Where are my boxes?

226
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:25,682  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
The garage flooded, sweetie,
and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.

227
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:27,361  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Just mine?

228
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:29,085  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm afraid so.

229
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,483  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

230
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,847  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
I used your boxes to divert
water away from the Porsche.

231
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,646  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

232
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,730  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
...so you could keep the bottom
of your car from water?

233
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,446  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
There was also
leaves and gook and stuff.

234
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,571  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe this!

235
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:58,242  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:524
Screw it. I'm having one.

236
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,729  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

237
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,969  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
How'd you like to sit
in a chair that reclines...

238
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,163  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
...has a rolling massage...

239
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,607  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and speakers in the headrest?

240
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,768  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've tried that so many times...

241
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,765  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
...they won't even let me
in the store anymore.

242
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,364  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
What if I said you could
do it in my apartment?

243
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,766  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you telling me...

244
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:27,209  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
...you bought the chair
that makes all others obsolete?

245
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:32,003  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
The chair that <i>Sit Magazine</i> called
"Chair of the Year"?

246
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:34,761  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just purchased...

247
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:39,011  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

248
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:41,362  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, that's awesome! That's great!
What made you do it?

249
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:44,405  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's a long story, but,
I broke Joey's chair...

250
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,206  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

251
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,643  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
I thought I did, that's why
I replaced it with mine.

252
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,601  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's how it got fixed!

253
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:58,044  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:524
You thought that elves
came in and fixed it?

254
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,571  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

255
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:01,570  X1:294 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:524
Angels.

256
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,563  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm getting my chair back.

257
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:10,763  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, looks like
it wasn't healed after all!

258
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:14,448  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
I guess this chair's mine now.

259
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,204  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, you broke my chair!

260
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,367  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your chair?

261
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:23,405  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.

262
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,250  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:524
So there was no miracle?

263
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,170  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, Joe. No miracle.

264
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:29,329  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, no! This is devastating!

265
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:35,324  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have
a new chair to get me through this.

266
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:41,646  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
Where can I find Earl?
He's the supply manager here.

267
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:43,245  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't know any Earl.

268
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,647  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm right here!

269
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:50,245  X1:313 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:524
Earl?

270
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,326  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm Phoebe.

271
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,851  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Phoebe?

272
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:57,327  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:524
The lady who sells toner?

273
00:16:57,532 --> 00:17:00,092  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, you can't kill yourself.

274
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:03,326  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I really appreciate
you coming down...

275
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:05,124  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, I can't let you do it.

276
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:09,411  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why?
- Because, fate made me call you today.

277
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,250  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought it was toner.

278
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:16,043  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job.

279
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,281  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
My first day, you're my first call.

280
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:22,922  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
Somebody else may have hung up,
but I wouldn't do that...

281
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,924  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:488 Y2:524
...because I know about this stuff.

282
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,732  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
- My mom killed herself.
- Really?

283
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,088  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
How?

284
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,805  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not gonna give you tips.

285
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:34,450  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't you see that this...

286
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:38,361  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
...all came together so I could
stop you from doing this?

287
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:42,761  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
- No, it's fate.

288
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:46,570  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
It doesn't really seem like
enough to be fate.

289
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:47,881  X1:285 X2:430 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, well.

290
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,889  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, here's a weird thing.

291
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:54,045  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:484 Y2:524
My mother was also a supply manager.

292
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,329  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm actually the office manager.

293
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,443  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God! So was she!

294
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,768  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
And get this, okay.

295
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:05,482  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.

296
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:07,848  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:524
Puh-Earl.

297
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,690  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Was there anything else?

298
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:11,881  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

299
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,522  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where're you from?

300
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:18,292  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Philadelphia.
- Oh, my God, so was she!

301
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,804  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've got goose bumps.

302
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,208  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

303
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:25,448  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.

304
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,162  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:484 Y2:524
These jerks might not care about you...

305
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:33,121  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but the universe does,
and that says a lot.

306
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:36,644  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you hear that?

307
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,487  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:524
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

308
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:41,683  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:488 Y2:524
...because the universe cares!

309
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:44,162  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:524
The whole universe!

310
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:52,244  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:524
I really wish they'd care
a little bit.

311
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:55,449  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, this is terrible.

312
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,603  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everything is destroyed.

313
00:18:58,972 --> 00:18:59,927  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look at this.

314
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,211  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't tell what it is.

315
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,403  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's still soft.

316
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,609  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you think this is?

317
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:15,009  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
I think it was a mouse.

318
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,971  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
- How are you, honey?
- How do you think I am?

319
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,527  X1:066 X2:649 Y1:482 Y2:524
You've wrecked my childhood memories...

320
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,370  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
...you love Ross more than me.

321
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:33,331  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

322
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:39,564  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sweetheart, we love you
just as much as Ross.

323
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,603  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry about what happened...

324
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:45,128  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and I probably can't
make it up to you...

325
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:47,124  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
...but here's a start.

326
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,924  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's this?
- It's the key to my Porsche.

327
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:55,202  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, the key to your Porsche.

328
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,367  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

329
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,130  X1:297 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?!

330
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:04,962  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my reflection the other day.

331
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:08,249  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:524
Your mother's right,
I do look like an ass.

332
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,932  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.

333
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:14,965  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, wait a minute.

334
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,721  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
A couple of stupid boxes get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

335
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:22,683  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Let's take a drive?
- All right!

336
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:26,362  X1:087 X2:627 Y1:488 Y2:524
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!

337
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:40,880  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:052 Y2:093
Hey, guys.

338
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,884  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:052 Y2:094
Have you seen Chandler's chair?

339
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,048  X1:141 X2:572 Y1:052 Y2:093
Joey broke it. He got rid of it.

340
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:49,291  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:131
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
