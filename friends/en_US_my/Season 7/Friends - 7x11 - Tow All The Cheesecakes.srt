00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,847  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
You have got to try this cheesecake.

2
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:10,691  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know, I'm not that much
of a sweet tooth...

3
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:14,088  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, my God, it's so creamy!

4
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:17,331  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had!

5
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:19,164  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
Where did you get this?

6
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:23,487  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was at the front door when I got
home. Somebody sent it to us.

7
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,130  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
This isn't addressed to you.

8
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:29,489  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:524
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!

9
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:31,171  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Thief!

10
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,327  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:524
I didn't read the box
before I opened it...

11
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:37,086  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and you can't return a box
after you opened it!

12
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:40,284  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why not?
- Because it's too delicious!

13
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:44,361  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
You stole this cheesecake.
That's wrong.

14
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:49,003  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:450 Y2:524
No, it'll be okay because Mrs. Braverman
will send for a free one.

15
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:50,884  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
That way, we all win.

16
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,880  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
The only losers are the
big cheesecake conglomerate...

17
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:57,481  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
..."Mama's Little Bakery. "

18
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:00,010  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I feel terrible.

19
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,607  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

20
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,484  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, what?

21
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,242  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One With All The Cheesecakes

SDI Media Group

23
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,681  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
I should get going. Big day at work.

24
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:48,888  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:488 Y2:524
You know how I'm in a coma?

25
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:53,001  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:126
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

26
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:55,001  X1:316 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
So...

27
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,725  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:052 Y2:093
Mr. Smarty Pants.

28
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:59,241  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:052 Y2:127
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

29
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:02,004  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:052 Y2:093
Pheebs, still on for tonight?

30
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,402  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Absolutely.
- I'll see you at 8.

31
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:06,125  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:052 Y2:089
What's at 8?

32
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:11,048  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:052 Y2:131
Dinner. We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you.

33
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,330  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:088
Wow! Did not know that.

34
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:17,006  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:052 Y2:093
May I say how lovely you look today?

35
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,201  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:524
Duly noted.

36
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:23,570  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:052 Y2:131
So for tomorrow, do you want to
rent a car and drive down together?

37
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,208  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What are you talking about?
- Cousin Frannie's wedding.

38
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:30,486  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:052 Y2:088
You were invited?

39
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:33,085  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:052 Y2:088
No.

40
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,487  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:052 Y2:094
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

41
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:38,007  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:524
I thought only Mom and Dad
were invited.

42
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:42,211  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:052 Y2:131
From the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparable.

43
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:46,081  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:052 Y2:126
Maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

44
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:50,603  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:052 Y2:132
It's probably just a mistake.
Let me call Aunt Cheryl.

45
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:54,083  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe you are invited and the
invitation got lost in the mail.

46
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:57,204  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:524
You call her and tell her
that when we were kids...

47
00:02:57,412 --> 00:03:00,563  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
...her precious Frannie
tried to undress me several times.

48
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:04,248  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
If I hadn't stopped her, there
wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

49
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:07,086  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
She tried to undress me too.

50
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:10,292  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

51
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:21,080  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

52
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:23,323  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:524
I think he's still out.
What's wrong?

53
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:25,802  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene.

54
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:28,930  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
I had plans with Joey,
and he left me this note.

55
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:32,488  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. Talk to you later.

56
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,284  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:524
Big Daddy. "

57
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:38,130  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
- "Big Daddy"?
- That's a nickname we were trying.

58
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:42,490  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what nickname
never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron. "

59
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:47,968  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
Here's Joseph Francis!

60
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:51,284  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait, what are you
middle-naming me for?

61
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,891  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:524
I left you a note.

62
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:55,322  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
That doesn't give you the
right to ditch me!

63
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:59,326  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
You can cancel plans with friends
if there's a possibility for sex.

64
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,403  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's right. That is the rule.

65
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:05,281  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't accept it. When we make
plans, I expect you to show up.

66
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:08,564  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not a way to kill time
till you meet someone better.

67
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:13,249  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
Boyfriends and girlfriends will
come and go, but this is for life.

68
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:17,366  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it would bother you this much.

69
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:18,886  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, it does.

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,162  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, can I make it up to you?

71
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:22,606  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:26,606  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'll pay for myself.

73
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:30,684  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, you wore me down.

74
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:36,485  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:524
While you're over there, how
about a beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

75
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,569  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:524
"Ross..." Is that back?

76
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,804  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
The other cheesecake came.

77
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,327  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
They delivered it here again.

78
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:52,885  X1:183 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the problem?

79
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,003  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't seem to say goodbye.

80
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,480  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you serious?

81
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:59,809  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
We ate an entire cake
two days ago and you want more?

82
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:02,566  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, I've forgotten
what it tastes like.

83
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:05,565  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:488 Y2:524
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

84
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:09,487  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
It had a buttery, crumbly,
graham cracker crust...

85
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,411  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
...with a very rich...

86
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:16,406  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
...yet light cream cheese filling.

87
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:20,881  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wow, my whole mouth
just filled with saliva.

88
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:24,372  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
Know what? Forget it.
We're just hungry.

89
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:26,961  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:524
We haven't had lunch.
We're just lightheaded.

90
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:30,568  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
So let's go have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

91
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:33,087  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:524
We'll drop it off
so we're not tempted.

92
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,409  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Where do you want to eat?
- Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago.

93
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:43,806  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:524
Mel Tormé died.

94
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,520  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
Joey, that paper's like a year old.

95
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:50,088  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:524
Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale
is over?

96
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,925  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
So, I finally heard back
from Aunt Cheryl...

97
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:58,606  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

98
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,524  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's limited seating...

99
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:05,288  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
Limited seating? I am just
one tiny person!

100
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,003  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

101
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:10,686  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, the last time she saw you...

102
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:14,811  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
...you'd have turned one of those
little wedding chairs into kindling.

103
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:19,132  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
"Limited seating. "
That's such a lame excuse.

104
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:21,800  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's not the reason
she's not inviting me.

105
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:25,681  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
What's the big deal? I wasn't invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

106
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:30,130  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
If it makes you feel any better, Joan
and I will just make an appearance...

107
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:33,523  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and then we'll leave early
as a sign of protest.

108
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:36,007  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joan?
- Yeah, my date.

109
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:40,091  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Assistant professor in linguistics.
Tall, very beautiful.

110
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:44,484  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:524
And despite what some people say,
not broad-backed.

111
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:48,524  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait a minute.
You got "Ross Geller and Guest"?

112
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:50,888  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
I wasn't invited,
and you got "and Guest"?

113
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:54,084  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:524
Excuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behalf.

114
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,163  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
I think the rule applies here.

115
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,488  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back...

116
00:06:58,732 --> 00:06:59,960  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Not broad-back!

117
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:03,807  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

118
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:05,531  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't cancel on Joan.

119
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,683  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why not?
- Did you not hear me?

120
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:11,567  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:524
She's an assistant professor
in the linguistics department.

121
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,689  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're wild.

122
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:17,483  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why do you want to come anyway?
- Because...

123
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:19,211  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:524
...she's my cousin.

124
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:22,125  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, we grew up together.

125
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:26,001  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
Family, you know?
And all that's important to me.

126
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:29,086  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, all right. I'll take you.

127
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:30,970  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll go call Joan.

128
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:33,690  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, that's nice.

129
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:35,610  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
Family should be there.

130
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:37,922  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's her wedding.
Happiest day of her life.

131
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:39,764  X1:278 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:524
We'll see.

132
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,363  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, thank you for lunch.

133
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,489  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait, I thought you paid.

134
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:51,286  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
Apparently, we don't pay
for food anymore.

135
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,692  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Do you see what I see?
- It's still there.

136
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,887  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:524
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

137
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,405  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
She could be out of town.
Maybe gone for months.

138
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,088  X1:074 X2:640 Y1:450 Y2:524
By then, it may spoil.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.

139
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,123  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:450 Y2:524
- It could kill her.
- Don't want that.

140
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:13,487  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're protecting her.

141
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:14,886  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We'll take it.
- But quick.

142
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:16,929  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why?
- I hear her in there.

143
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:19,447  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go! Go! Go!

144
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,084  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, my God, that's David.

145
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:27,163  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Who?
- David, the scientist guy.

146
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,289  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:488 Y2:524
David that I was in love with.

147
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,926  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
Who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

148
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:33,167  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

149
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,607  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
Say their name enough,
they turn around.

150
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:38,886  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Phoebe.

151
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,009  X1:303 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
David.

152
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:46,410  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

153
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,291  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just in town for a conference.

154
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:51,960  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
God, you look phenomenal.

155
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,565  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well... .

156
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:54,966  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

157
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:58,410  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?

158
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:01,086  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.

159
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:04,888  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look, I got a confession to make.

160
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,282  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was hoping to run into you here.

161
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:11,121  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
I didn't know if I should call.
I was only in town a few days...

162
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,687  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and I didn't want to intrude
on your life.

163
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:15,689  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
I really wanted to see you...

164
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:18,730  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

165
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:23,844  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.

166
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,885  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
Really? Because I think about you
all the time.

167
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:31,011  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's a statue in Minsk
that reminds me of you so much.

168
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:33,368  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's actually of Lenin...

169
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,689  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:484 Y2:524
...but, you know, at certain angles... .

170
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,966  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

171
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,486  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

172
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:43,330  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no!

173
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:45,731  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What?
- I can't.

174
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:49,089  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe I have plans.
Can you do it tomorrow?

175
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:53,683  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

176
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:56,486  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
Listen, next time you're in Minsk... .

177
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,884  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:524
Phoebe? Can I talk to you
for a second?

178
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,531  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing?

179
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:03,171  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
I have plans with Joey.

180
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:04,891  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:524
So? He'll understand.

181
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,686  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

182
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:12,807  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
I made a whole speech about how
you do not cancel plans with friends.

183
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:16,604  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
And now just because, potentially,
the love of my life...

184
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:19,002  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:446 Y2:524
...returns from Russia
for one night...

185
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,925  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I should change my beliefs?

186
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:24,128  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
I should change my beliefs!

187
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:29,083  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
No. If I don't have my principles,
I don't have anything.

188
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,407  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're so strong.

189
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:34,486  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
Or I should rush through dinner
with Joey and meet David at 9.

190
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,562  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, that is so good!

191
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:46,122  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm full. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

192
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:47,885  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I'll regret it.

193
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,529  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, what have you got there?

194
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,091  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, it's... .

195
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:55,482  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's tofu cake. Want some?

196
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,284  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing tonight?

197
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:03,688  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:524
Dude. Dude.

198
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:06,205  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:524
Sorry.

199
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,090  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
I got plans with Phoebe.

200
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,011  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:524
Really? Monica said
she had a date at 9.

201
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,812  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What? Tonight?
- That's what Monica said.

202
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:18,489  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:446 Y2:524
After that speech, she makes a date on
the same night she has plans with me?

203
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,365  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
She's trying to pull a fast one
on Big Daddy.

204
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:29,481  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:486 Y2:524
Here, I think this is us.

205
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:33,086  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
Limited seating, my ass.

206
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,283  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let's see who made the cut.

207
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,369  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hi. I'm Monica Geller.

208
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,882  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How do you know the bride and groom?
- I worked with Frannie.

209
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:43,327  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:524
Used to work with her. Used to.

210
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:45,767  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm a relative
and I didn't get invited.

211
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,367  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:488 Y2:524
A blood relative. Blood.

212
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,690  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:524
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.

213
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:55,722  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:484 Y2:524
And you? How do you know the couple?

214
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,082  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
We went to college with both of them.

215
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,283  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:524
Now we live next door.

216
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:01,925  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, you're fine.

217
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:08,568  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes.

218
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,885  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'll have a green salad,
house dressing and water's fine.

219
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:14,611  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:524
And for you, sir?

220
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:17,366  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

221
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,051  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
...how slow are we talking?

222
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:22,082  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's already been roasted.

223
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:25,961  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
the specials again.

224
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,680  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
We've heard the specials three times.

225
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:32,766  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very special lobster ravioli.

226
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:37,483  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Actually, we're out of the ravioli.
- Well, that changes everything!

227
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,725  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what, Pheebs?
You were right before.

228
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:43,883  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:524
Friends are so important.

229
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:46,287  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

230
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,005  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
Know what I really want?

231
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:51,289  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?
- Is to have a long, long talk.

232
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:55,286  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and really open him up.

233
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,044  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Any progress?
- Yes.

234
00:12:58,732 --> 00:13:00,927  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:524
I will have the lobster ravioli.

235
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,962  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

236
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,725  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What's the rush?
- Well...

237
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,486  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I have an appointment.

238
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,489  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
And it's very important.

239
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:11,881  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
What is it?

240
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:13,960  X1:300 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well...

241
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:15,531  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:524
...it's a date.

242
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:20,129  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
A date? No, you must be mistaken,
because you wouldn't have a date...

243
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,886  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
...on the same night
you have plans with a friend.

244
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:24,884  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't make me feel badly.

245
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:26,491  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, I'm gonna!

246
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:31,521  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
You made me feel really guilty
about going out with that girl.

247
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:35,486  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Like I did something terrible.
Now you're doing the same thing.

248
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,887  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's not! It's totally different!

249
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:41,164  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

250
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:42,925  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's very special to me.

251
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,528  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:524
My girl the other night was special.
She was a scientist too.

252
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:49,570  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
- She was?
- Well, she graduated high school.

253
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,004  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:488 Y2:524
Whatever. Know what?

254
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:55,688  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's only here for four
hours and I'm gonna go see him.

255
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,530  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Fine!
- Yeah.

256
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:03,486  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
What are you still doing here?
I told you, lobster ravioli!

257
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:09,890  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.

258
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:12,287  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
I wouldn't have missed this.

259
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,523  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I'm very glad you're here.

260
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:17,082  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

261
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,288  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
Come on, we're going to my place.

262
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:28,201  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

263
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:34,249  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
I will give you $ 100
to whistle right now.

264
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,326  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
- How can you eat it without me?
- What'll you do?

265
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:45,360  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them everything.

266
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:49,287  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're dessert stealers.
We're living outside the law.

267
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:51,687  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't trust you with this cake.

268
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,201  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got it first,
and I'm taking it back!

269
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:57,171  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What? Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

270
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:59,882  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
You think I trust you with it?

271
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,611  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, we'll split it.

272
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:03,564  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's not fair. You had some.

273
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:06,531  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
I think Monica would be
very interested to know...

274
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,570  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
...that you called her cheesecake
"dry and mealy. "

275
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,882  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do we use to split it?

276
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,289  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, pick a half.

277
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:20,290  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, this side looks bigger.

278
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,489  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:524
But there's more crust on this side.

279
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:26,370  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe if I measure it...

280
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:27,727  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Pick a piece!

281
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:31,681  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
- All right, I pick that one.
- It's the smaller piece.

282
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,163  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. There you go.

283
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:37,290  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
Enjoy your half, my friend.
But that is it.

284
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:40,689  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

285
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:43,122  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
...if you eat your piece too fast.

286
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,841  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You gonna give me some of yours?
- Oh, no.

287
00:15:57,132 --> 00:16:01,091  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

288
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:04,091  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
I may just sit here
and have my cake all day.

289
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:07,290  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just sit here in the hallway
and eat my...

290
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:20,569  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:486 Y2:524
Ross, sweetheart!

291
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,609  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.

292
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:26,686  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
- Yes, it is.

293
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:33,002  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
Every time, on the lips!

294
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:35,129  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why? Why on the lips?

295
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:40,686  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

296
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,684  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
You be nice, all right?

297
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,122  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
I didn't bring you to ambush her.

298
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,364  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
Frannie was the one
who showed your <i>Playboys</i> to Mom.

299
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:50,489  X1:272 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
That bitch.

300
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:55,801  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica!

301
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:57,201  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:524
What...?

302
00:16:57,452 --> 00:16:59,761  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
Am I doing here?
Surprised to see me?

303
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,287  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
Ross brought me.
How do you like that?

304
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,881  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.

305
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:09,684  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
You invite my whole family,
and not me? Why?

306
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:13,242  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
Why wouldn't you want me here?
What could I have done?

307
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,490  X1:299 X2:416 Y1:488 Y2:524
Stuart!

308
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:19,401  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
I believe you know my husband.

309
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:24,691  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:524
So it's really a question
of "who" could you have done.

310
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:35,247  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
I hate this, but I have to go.

311
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:37,522  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't miss my flight.

312
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:40,002  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
I bet there's
another flight to Minsk in...

313
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:41,890  X1:311 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:524
July.

314
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:53,611  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?

315
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:56,286  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Please clean my beakers. "

316
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,803  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't get out of the lab much.

317
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:03,880  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought it meant something else.

318
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:07,522  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, well, I really actually
wanted to say...

319
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,205  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:524
...that.

320
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:12,728  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
But I figured I probably shouldn't
because...

321
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,364  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:524
...I have to leave.

322
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:18,001  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, you're right. Don't say it.

323
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:21,728  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:524
I do, though.

324
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:25,131  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
I do too.

325
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:35,284  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, bye, Phoebe.

326
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:49,567  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:524
Now's not the time, Joey.
You can yell at me tomorrow.

327
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:52,485  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait, no, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yell at you.

328
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,200  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just started thinking
about you and David...

329
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:59,445  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he left.

330
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,523  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

331
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:07,802  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

332
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:11,721  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
The only guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

333
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:14,532  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and I may never see him again.

334
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:16,490  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
You could always visit him.

335
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:19,206  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:524
Right. Like they'll let me
have a passport.

336
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,211  X1:079 X2:635 Y1:484 Y2:524
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:27,008  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, now...

338
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:31,165  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
...if you achieve distillation of
subatomic particles before he does...

339
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:33,130  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:524
...then he could come back.

340
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,727  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
I could give it a shot.

341
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,928  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, look! There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

342
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:53,687  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Stick to your side!
- Come on, now!

343
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:06,331  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, what are we having?

344
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,401  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.

345
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,882  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, wait here.

346
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:36,767  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:052 Y2:093
Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving?

347
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:39,526  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Well...
- Give us a kiss. Come on.

348
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:51,607  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:052 Y2:093
Why? Why on the lips?
