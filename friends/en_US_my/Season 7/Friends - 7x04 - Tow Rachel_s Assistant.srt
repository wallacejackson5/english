00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,204
We learned one thing, Cheese:

2
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:08,762
Cheerleaders and high explosives
don 't mix.

3
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:12,963
You can say that again, Mac.

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,601
I couldn 't have done it alone.
You're a genius.

5
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:20,721
Oh, yeah? Well, how come I can 't get
my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?

6
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:28,765
What did you guys think?

7
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,481
-Hey, the phone.
-I got it. I got it.

8
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,085
Hold on. It's your mom.

9
00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:40,129
-It's Mommy.
-That's nice.

10
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,442
Ma, so what did you think?

11
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:44,487
Well. . .

12
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,167
. . .that was okay.

13
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:48,686
It wasn't the best.

14
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:51,281
That was one
of the worst things ever. . .

15
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:54,887
. . .and not just on TV.

16
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:57,682
-What should we say?
-The lighting was okay.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,890
You got lighting last time.
Lighting is mine.

18
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,321
I have costumes.

19
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:03,925
That means I'm stuck with:

20
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:09,087
"So we were watching you in there, and
you were sitting right here. Whoa. "

21
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:12,128
-What about you?
-I don't know.

22
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,523
I can't lie to him again.
Oh, no, l-- No.

23
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:18,411
I'm just gonna press
my breasts up against him.

24
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:21,848
-And say nothing?
-Yeah, that's right.

25
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,763
Wow, my folks really liked it.

26
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:27,445
What did you guys think?

27
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:35,285
It wasn't that good.

28
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:40,208
The One With Rachel's Assistant

30
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:20,087
Do you think that your favorite animal
says much about you?

31
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,044
You mean behind my back?

32
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:26,650
You'll never believe
what happened to me today.

33
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:28,928
-I am sitting in my office--
-You guys!

34
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,770
Guess what my agent just said?

35
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:32,650
I'm in the middle of a story here.

36
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:34,166
Sorry, you finish.

37
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:37,165
I'm sitting in my office,
and guess who walks in.

38
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:39,369
I'm gonna be on two TV shows.

39
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:40,601
That's great.

40
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,409
-Joey.
-You weren't finished?

41
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:46,724
Yeah, "Guess who walks
into my office" is my story.

42
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,768
Ralph Lauren walked into my office.

43
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:53,527
If you're starting another story,
at least let me finish mine.

44
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,205
It's the same story.

45
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,121
Wow, it's really long.

46
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:03,361
Ralph just came in to tell me
that he's so happy with my work. . .

47
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:07,525
. . .that he wants me to be the new
merchandising manager for Polo retail.

48
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,723
Still get a discount on wedding gowns?

49
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,928
I'm so happy for you.

50
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:15,567
These really are
the "days of our lives. "

51
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,768
-What?
-Well, since you ask. . . .

52
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,480
They want me back on
Days of Our Lives.

53
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:23,091
I get a big pay raise!

54
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:24,361
Oh, hey!

55
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:27,922
I'll be playing Drake Ramoray's
twin brother, Stryker.

56
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:31,121
I get to hire my own assistant.

57
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,332
I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

58
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:42,644
You were at this job four years?

59
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:47,170
-That's right.
-This is all very impressive, Hilda.

60
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,562
I just have one last question for you.

61
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:52,530
How did I do? Was this okay?

62
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,928
-What?
-I've never interviewed anyone.

63
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,163
I've never had anyone work for me.

64
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:01,563
When I was a kid we had a maid,
but this isn't the same.

65
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:03,968
No, dear, it's not.

66
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:06,365
And I know that.

67
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:09,648
Well, thank you so much for coming in.

68
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,803
-Nice to meet you.
-Good meeting you.

69
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,371
All right.

70
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:16,370
I'm a total pro.

71
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:19,967
-Hello.
-Wow.

72
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:24,291
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The models are down the hall.

73
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,682
I'm here about the assistant job.

74
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,161
Really?

75
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:32,611
Okay, well, then, all right.
Well, just have a seat there.

76
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:34,080
So what's your name?

77
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:35,361
Tag Jones.

78
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,330
Uh-huh, go on.

79
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,363
That's it. That's my whole name.

80
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:42,568
That's your whole name.
Of course.

81
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:45,407
Okay, let's just have a look-see here.

82
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,201
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much experience--

83
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:53,365
What are you talking about?
You got three years painting houses. . .

84
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:57,362
. . .two whole summers
at TGI Friday's.

85
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,201
It's lame, I know.

86
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:02,171
But I'm a goal-oriented person,
eager to learn--

87
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,169
Just hold on a second, please.

88
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:12,371
It's for human resources. Everybody
has to. Would you stand up?

89
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:21,571
No, no, no.

90
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,366
Hey.

91
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,572
-Anyway, I should go.
-Okay. Bye.

92
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,490
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hi, sweetie.

93
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,688
What was with all the whispering?

94
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,043
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

95
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:50,888
Secret? Married people aren't
supposed to have secrets.

96
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,646
We love and respect
one another too much.

97
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,561
But still, no.

98
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:01,371
We should tell each other everything.
I don't have secrets from you.

99
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:05,884
Really? So tell me what happened
to Ross, junior year at Disneyland.

100
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,770
No, I can't do that.

101
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,408
I'll tell you what Phoebe said.

102
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,161
-Okay.
-Okay.

103
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,642
So Ross and I
are going to Disneyland.

104
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,962
We stop at this restaurant for tacos.

105
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:21,649
When I say restaurant, I mean a guy,
a hibachi, and the trunk of his car.

106
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:24,209
So Ross has about ten tacos.

107
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:28,809
Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

108
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:30,565
Oh, my God. He threw up?

109
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:33,690
No, he visited a town
a little south of throw up.

110
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:38,524
What was Phoebe's secret?

111
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:42,571
Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
old massage place, is getting fired.

112
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,330
That's it? I gave up my
Disneyland story for that?

113
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:52,166
That's right. You lose, sucker!

114
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,170
Please still marry me.

115
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:01,763
You have an assistant, right?

116
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:03,001
Did she call?

117
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:06,927
You told her I was sick, right?
Always tell her I am sick.

118
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,366
I don't know.
How do you decide who to hire?

119
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:12,210
I have it down to two people.

120
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,364
One has great references
and a lot of experience.

121
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:17,881
-And then, there's this guy.
-What about him?

122
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,646
I love him.

123
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,363
He's so pretty, I want to cry.

124
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,891
I don't know what to do.

125
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:29,568
Come on, you know what to do.
You hire the first one.

126
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:34,243
Don't hire assistants because they're
cute. Do it because they're qualified.

127
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:36,160
Uh-huh.

128
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:41,684
I hear you. You make a lot of sense.
Can I just say one more thing?

129
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:43,081
Look how pretty.

130
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:46,081
Let me see.

131
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,963
Oh, my God.

132
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,408
Oh. But, no.

133
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:54,724
No. You can't hire him
because it's not professional.

134
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,363
This is for me, yes?

135
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:02,164
Okay, you're right.
I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.

136
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:05,051
Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.

137
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:06,801
Let me see.

138
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,563
Wow!

139
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:12,768
Don't show this to Monica.

140
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,281
And don't tell her about the "Wow! "

141
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,605
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Terry.

142
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,968
-Nice to see you again.
-Been a while.

143
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,891
Funny, these halls look smaller
than they used to.

144
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,369
It's a different building.

145
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:33,567
So. . .

146
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:36,202
. . .Stryker Ramoray, huh?

147
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:38,602
-When do I start?
-How about right now?

148
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,171
Okay.

149
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,768
Here are the audition scenes.

150
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,686
I thought you
were offering me the part.

151
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:49,967
Why?

152
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:53,562
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray,
Stryker's twin brother.

153
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:56,201
Who looks more like me than me, right?

154
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,366
Everybody has to audition.

155
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:03,970
You know, Terry,
I don't really need to do this.

156
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,766
I got my own cable TV series. . .

157
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:08,770
. . .with a robot.

158
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:12,885
I'm sorry, Joey.
That's the way it is.

159
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:14,960
Well. . .

160
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,002
. . .I guess you think
you're pretty special.

161
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:21,562
Sitting up here in your fancy,
small-halled building. . .

162
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,487
. . .making stars jump
through hoops for you.

163
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,165
Well, you know what?

164
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,645
This is one star whose hoop--

165
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,962
This is the star the hoop--
This hoop--

166
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:36,089
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray!

167
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,886
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?

168
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,408
I came to thank you for not laughing
in my face yesterday.

169
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:52,928
I noticed there were no plants
so I brought you your first.

170
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,368
There is a plant in your office.

171
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,491
Kind of.

172
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,447
Right.

173
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,646
So I guess I shouldn't put
"good at noticing stuff" on my résumé.

174
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,083
-Thank you.
-Anyway. . .

175
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,289
. . .I'm guessing you hired somebody.

176
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:10,081
Well. . . .

177
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:11,646
Gotcha.

178
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,043
Thanks again for meeting with me.

179
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,046
But I hired you.

180
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,843
-What?
-Yeah, you got the job.

181
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,963
-You're my new assistant.
-I am?

182
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,565
Yeah.

183
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:28,849
-I can't believe it.
-Me either.

184
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,521
First, I need you to go downstairs. . .

185
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,411
. . .find a woman named Hilda,
and tell her to go home.

186
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:42,130
-Hey.
-Hey, good you're home.

187
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,485
Always nicer to hear than,
"Oh, crap, you again. "

188
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,248
Hey, sweetie, I made you a surprise.

189
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:51,244
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, tacos.

190
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,330
Ever since that story,
I've had such a craving.

191
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,283
Did you not understand the story?

192
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,005
-Hey.
-Hey, what's up?

193
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,490
Nothing. Just figuring out
what to do for dinner.

194
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:11,209
Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff?
You making dinner?

195
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,481
No.

196
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,525
What's over there? Tacos?

197
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:19,330
No. No.

198
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:24,207
They're just ground beef smileys.

199
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,366
Those are tacos.

200
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:30,006
Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.

201
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:34,606
Either way, I'll pass.
Still can't eat those.

202
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,120
What's so funny?

203
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:50,285
I'm not laughing.

204
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:00,284
You told her!

205
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,806
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.

206
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:10,651
Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
It's not like I chose to do it!

207
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:14,601
It's not like I said,
"What would make this ride more fun?"

208
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:19,201
Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.

209
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,727
I should be
laying down papers for you.

210
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:27,411
-How could you?
-I had to. We're getting married.

211
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:30,001
Married couples can't keep secrets.

212
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:33,010
I guess Monica should know
about Atlantic City.

213
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,611
Dude!

214
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:38,610
-What happened?
-Chandler and I are in a bar. . .

215
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,121
Did you not hear me say, "Dude"?

216
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:45,123
. . .and this girl
is making eyes at Chandler.

217
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:49,928
So he goes over to her and, after
a minute or two, I see them kissing.

218
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:54,444
You're thinking he's not the type
to go to bars and make out with girls.

219
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,603
And you're right.
He's not the type. . .

220
00:12:56,852 --> 00:13:00,811
. . .to go to bars
and make out with girls.

221
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:04,323
You kissed a guy?

222
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:07,605
Oh, my God!

223
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:11,851
In my defense, it was dark
and he was a very pretty guy.

224
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,250
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard--

225
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,002
So hard we had to throw out
your underwear again?

226
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,408
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

227
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:30,771
-Hi.
-Hey.

228
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,650
How's Hilda working out?

229
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:37,762
Oh, my new assistant
is working out. Yes.

230
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,810
She happy she got the job?

231
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:45,211
My new assistant is very happy
that I hired my new assistant.

232
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,566
Hello.

233
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:51,042
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?

234
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:55,245
It's the producers at Mac and Cheese,
if you'll excuse me for a minute.

235
00:13:56,932 --> 00:14:01,164
Hey, funny you should call. I was
just looking over next week's script.

236
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:03,571
Canceled!

237
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,887
Like, they're taking it off the air?

238
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,170
All right, I'll see you Monday.

239
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,525
We're not even shooting them anymore?

240
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,962
All right. Bye.

241
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,208
They canceled Mac and Cheese!

242
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:21,726
-Sorry.
-Sorry, Joey.

243
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:24,605
Why would they do that?
It was a good show, right?

244
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,801
You want to tell secrets?
Okay, in college. . .

245
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,964
. . .Ross used to wear leg warmers.

246
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:48,162
All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla
lce look-alike contest and won.

247
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:51,968
Ross came in fourth and cried!

248
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:56,927
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?

249
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,851
Maybe Chandler should know
your secrets too.

250
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:04,010
I already told him everything.
You shush!

251
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,127
Once, she was sent to bed
without dinner. . .

252
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,205
. . .so she ate the macaroni off
a jewelry box she'd made.

253
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:16,447
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch Golden Girls.

254
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:21,326
Monica couldn't tell time
until she was 1 3.

255
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,488
It's hard for some people!

256
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,804
Of course it is.

257
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,923
Wow.

258
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:33,330
-Chandler wore my underwear to work!
-Hey!

259
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,931
I'm sorry, I couldn't think
of any more for Ross.

260
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,850
In college, Chandler got drunk. . .

261
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:42,925
. . .and slept with the lady
who cleaned our dorm.

262
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:45,166
That was you.

263
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:50,526
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

264
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:54,324
How could this happen to me?

265
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:59,088
Yesterday, I had two TV shows.
Today, I got nothing.

266
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,051
Wait a minute,
what happened to Days of our Lives?

267
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,244
Well, they might be a little mad
at me over there.

268
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:06,841
What happened?

269
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:12,041
Well, maybe I got a little upset, and
maybe I told them where they could go.

270
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,648
Joey, why would you do that?

271
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,247
Because! They wanted me to audition.

272
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:20,728
You, an actor? That's madness!

273
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,644
Rachel Green's office.

274
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,041
Tag.

275
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,691
Hi, who was that?

276
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:38,044
Nobody. I was just practicing.

277
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,441
Really?

278
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:47,645
-Hi.
-Hi, Rachel Green's office.

279
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:50,850
You must be Hilda.

280
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:56,283
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?

281
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:57,647
Phoebe.

282
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,884
-Great name.
-You like that?

283
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:02,652
-You should hear my phone number.
-Okay.

284
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:10,650
So you hired yourself
a little treat, did you?

285
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:14,082
I know how it looks,
but I am telling you--

286
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,721
You can't get involved
with your assistant.

287
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:21,488
I know that, and I know hiring him was
not the smartest thing I've ever done.

288
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:25,281
But, from now on,
I swear this is strictly professional.

289
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:26,885
-Yes.
-Hey, Rachel.

290
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:28,081
Hi.

291
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:30,766
Cute assistant. What's his story?

292
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,162
-Is he--
-Gay? Yeah.

293
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,890
Hey, Terry.

294
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:42,326
Joey Tribbiani.

295
00:17:42,532 --> 00:17:46,081
Surprised your big head
could fit through our small halls.

296
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,288
-I gotta go, Joey.
-Wait, Terry! Look.

297
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,363
I'm really sorry about before.

298
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,684
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
to audition for you.

299
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:57,048
-Give me another chance.
-I can't.

300
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,004
Wait, Terry, please!

301
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,087
Look, I just lost my other job, okay?

302
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,369
You have no idea how much I need this.

303
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:07,045
Please, help me out.

304
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,243
For old times' sake.

305
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,689
This guy's been in a coma
for five years. It's hopeless.

306
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,810
It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
is a miracle worker.

307
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:18,042
Here he comes.

308
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,251
Good morning.

309
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:30,643
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
Can you hear me?

310
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:32,843
And cut.

311
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,848
I'm back, baby!

312
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,967
You know, in my defense. . .

313
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:54,648
. . .there was no glitter on
the macaroni and very little glue.

314
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,482
And in my defense,
the cleaning lady came on to me.

315
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:02,770
-Do you have trouble telling time now?
-No.

316
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:05,606
-Quick, what time is it?
-Time to kiss a guy?

317
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:12,251
What are you laughing at, Pampers?

318
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:16,488
You know when I said
married people. . .

319
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:19,451
. . .should share everything
and not have any secrets?

320
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,241
-Yeah?
-That was stupid. Let's not do that.

321
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:24,922
Absolutely.

322
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:29,091
We should keep the stuff we told
each other secret from everyone else.

323
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,084
Yeah, definitely.

324
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,329
Okay. If you'll excuse me. . .

325
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,565
. . .I'm gonna hang out with people who
don't know the Space Mountain story.

326
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:42,886
-Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
-Man!

327
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:48,604
Not that you would, but I wouldn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

328
00:19:58,812 --> 00:19:59,801
Hi.

329
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:04,447
-Do you have a minute?
-Sure. What's up?

330
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:08,368
I got asked out twice today
while I was at lunch. . .

331
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,250
. . .by guys.

332
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:13,601
-Really?
-Yeah.

333
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,128
Did you tell someone that I was gay?

334
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:19,529
Oh, did you not want people
to know that?

335
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:25,328
I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
want you to think I was gay.

336
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:27,325
Why is that?

337
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:32,528
-I don't think I should say.
-Oh, you can say.

338
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,807
Come on, I don't want you to feel
like you can't tell me things.

339
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:41,527
-Okay.
-Okay.

340
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,244
-Well. . .
-Yeah.

341
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,887
. . .I'd love to ask out
your friend Phoebe.

342
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,484
Yeah, she's gay.
