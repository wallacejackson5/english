00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:06,883  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
- No, no, no.

2
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:09,812  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,045  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:524
We're playing a game
I learned.

4
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:14,687  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:524
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

5
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,401  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
What? That's like insanely easy.

6
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:20,081  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's harder than it sounds.
You always forget one.

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,325  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:524
Or in some cases, 14.

8
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:28,845  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's stupid and I wasn't playing with
people, so technically, I didn't lose.

9
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,964  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
You forgot 14 states?

10
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:33,443  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

11
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,166  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, time's up.

12
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:37,692  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, I got 4<i>8</i>.

13
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,326  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's not bad. Pheebs?

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:43,446  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got tired of naming states,
so I listed the types of celery.

15
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,449  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I have one, regular celery.

16
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:52,452  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
So Rachel's got 4<i>8</i>
and Phoebe has the lead in...

17
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,251  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
...vegetables. Joey?

18
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:58,605  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

19
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,650  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Wow, how many you got?
- Fifty-six.

20
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,009  X1:057 X2:660 Y1:482 Y2:524
The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs

00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,328  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, how is New England not a state?

23
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,610  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:052 Y2:093
They have a sports team.

24
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,603  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:484 Y2:524
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

25
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,252  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
There you go.

26
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,084  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:052 Y2:093
Why one extra place setting?

27
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:58,726  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
You invited your assistant.

28
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,533  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:052 Y2:094
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

29
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,492  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:052 Y2:126
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's with her.

30
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:05,648  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why didn't you tell me?

31
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,010  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:052 Y2:131
I made him his own
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

32
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:12,209  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:052 Y2:131
I was going to,
but then I figured...

33
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:15,530  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:052 Y2:131
...your food is so delicious
and perfect...

34
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:18,924  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:052 Y2:131
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

35
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:24,004  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:052 Y2:129
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
since it's so fake, but I still do.

36
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:26,842  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:052 Y2:093
Regular celery!

37
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,811  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:052 Y2:093
I already have that.

38
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:32,328  X1:296 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Done...

39
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:34,529  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:052 Y2:093
...with time to spare.

40
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:39,204  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:052 Y2:132
- This may be a new world's record.
- I hate to lecture you guys...

41
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:42,923  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:052 Y2:132
...but it's disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

42
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:47,610  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and Joey can't name all the states.

43
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:53,007  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
You ever see a map or one of those
round colorful things called a globe?

44
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,082  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
Magellan? You got 46 states.

45
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,808  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What? That's impossible.
- Forty-six.

46
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:04,284  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. L-Forgot-Ten-States?

47
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,204  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

48
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:11,291  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

49
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,085  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am only one man.

50
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,687  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay, time is up.
- Now, just give me another minute.

51
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,930  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you don't know them by now,
you never will, okay?

52
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:25,012  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

53
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,404  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is crazy. I can do this.

54
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,929  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
All right, I bet I can get
all 50 before dinner.

55
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,283  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

56
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:34,812  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're on.

57
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:38,523  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't look at my list, because there's
a lot on there that you don't have.

58
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,164  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did you know your oven doesn't work?

59
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:46,126  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
The drawer full of takeout
menus is okay, right?

60
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,527  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

61
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,041  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:524
Chandler, give me a hand.

62
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:57,247  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey, do not let Ross look at maps
or the globe in your apartment.

63
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:00,286  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't worry.
It's not a globe of the United States.

64
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:10,207  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

65
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,603  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

66
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:15,247  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Oh, it's not.
- Seriously, it's moving.

67
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,803  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What the hell's in there?
- It's just my knitting. That's all.

68
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,409  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, I knit this.

69
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,406  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm very good.

70
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:36,925  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
Ross' apartment is nice.
Why don't we hang out here?

71
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:38,845  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe because it smells weird.

72
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:41,209  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's like old pumpkins or something.

73
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,605  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
- That's my pie.
- Which smells delicious.

74
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:47,004  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

75
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,090  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
We left Joey alone with the food.

76
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,446  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yep, yep, I knew it.

77
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,206  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
There he is...

78
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:56,405  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
...feeding stuffing to a dog!

79
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:04,612  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

80
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,289  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why is a dog in our apartment?

81
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,211  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, who's this?

82
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,284  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's a dog sitting on my couch.

83
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:15,451  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue!

84
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,849  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
- There's no dog here.
- There is!

85
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,129  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's black and white and shaggy.

86
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,608  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>He's sitting next to Rachel</i>
<i>and licking her hand. </i>

87
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,202  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God! Where are you?

88
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:29,883  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll be right there.

89
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,361  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're here already?
How are they doing this?!

90
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,283  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

91
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:45,565  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wanted to see if your offer
was still good.

92
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:47,684  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, sure. Come in.

93
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,444  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

94
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:52,809  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
We kind of broke up this morning.

95
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:56,289  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

96
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:59,007  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ohio, thank you.

97
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:04,926  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where's the dog?

98
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,203  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
What dog? There's no dog here.

99
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,409  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, that dog left.

100
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:14,571  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.

101
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:16,969  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's no dog in here.

102
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,603  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

103
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,122  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, that's just me coughing.

104
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:29,572  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, good. There you are.

105
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:32,725  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
Listen, I have a dog in my room.

106
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,726  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
What is it doing here?

107
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,128  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm watching it for friends
who left town.

108
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,528  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait.

109
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:42,532  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

110
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:45,727  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
May I please stay
with you nice people?

111
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,931  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wish he could stay,
but Chandler's allergic.

112
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,851  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
Extremely allergic, okay?

113
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:55,130  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
If I'm anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

114
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,841  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
...my throat will just close up.

115
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:01,443  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's odd. This dog's been
living here for the past three days.

116
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,521  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

117
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,446  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:444 Y2:524
If he's been here
that long...

118
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,890  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
...without a reaction, maybe
you're not allergic to it.

119
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,606  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
It still has to go, right?

120
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:17,928  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why?

121
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,726  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, it's...
- Don't do it!

122
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,530  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Don't do what?
- I have to.

123
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,923  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay? It's time.

124
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:33,521  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I hate dogs.

125
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,610  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?!
- That's crazy? Why?

126
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:38,532  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:484 Y2:524
Told you.

127
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,532  X1:228 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
They are needy...

128
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,531  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
...jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

129
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:50,128  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and that scares me a little bit.

130
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:53,292  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're right. They are scary.

131
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:56,724  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

132
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,244  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait. Do you not like all dogs?

133
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:01,812  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, not even puppies?

134
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:03,571  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is there a puppy here?

135
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,772  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You don't like puppies?
- Okay, you are new.

136
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:15,805  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, Chandler, I told you. Never
tell anyone about this dog thing.

137
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,884  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

138
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:22,571  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You don't like ice cream?
- It's too cold!

139
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,531  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

140
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,166  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hurts my teeth.

141
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,164  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...

142
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:34,883  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?

143
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:38,364  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
So either the dog goes or I go.

144
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,564  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

145
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,371  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
How can I not get this?

146
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,963  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm a college professor.
I got 1 450 on my SATs.

147
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,527  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:524
Twelve fifty.

148
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:00,564  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Damn, I forgot you were here.

149
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,369  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

150
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:04,762  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:524
We'll be back soon.

151
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,770  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can I ask you a question?

152
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,643  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
When a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

153
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:13,766  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
...what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before making a move?

154
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,565  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd say about a month.

155
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,769  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
Really? I'd say three to four.

156
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:18,849  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:524
Half-hour.

157
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,372  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Interesting.

158
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:26,930  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
When it's your assistant,
I'd say never.

159
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,569  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

160
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:34,561  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

161
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:38,769  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:524
A "moo" point?

162
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,566  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

163
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,967  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
It just doesn't matter.

164
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:50,772  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's "moo. "

165
00:09:57,053 --> 00:10:00,363  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
Have I been living with him
for too long, or did that make sense?

166
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:02,602  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't listen to Joey.

167
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,451  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, would you look at him?

168
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,292  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

169
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:11,287  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
What he needs right now is
for you to be his friend.

170
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:13,961  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

171
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:17,961  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
- Fine, take their advice.

172
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:19,612  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:524
No one ever listens to me.

173
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:23,163  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

174
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,766  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
How you holding up?

175
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:34,606  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Not bad.

176
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:37,964  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
- Thanks.

177
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:42,252  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Were you guys together a long time?
- A year, on and off.

178
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,764  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
I thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

179
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:48,362  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Now that she broke up with you.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,162  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's weird.

181
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:55,605  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:524
I used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

182
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:59,726  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
That all that was just a given.
Lately, it's like, what if it's not?

183
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,125  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you ever have that feeling?

184
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,766  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

185
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:05,368  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

186
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:08,568  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
All the time.
Constantly. It's terrifying.

187
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,930  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:524
But you know, then I figure
it has to work out.

188
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:13,848  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why?

189
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,564  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
Because it has to.

190
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:21,162  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You have all the answers, don't you?
- No, no, I do. I really do.

191
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,803  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Thanks for talking to me.
- Come on, what are bosses for?

192
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,372  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hug it out.

193
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:30,931  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, he likes you back.

194
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,763  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
Told you you should go for it.

195
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,292  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

196
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:43,650  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Street noise drown any of that out?

197
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,328  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
No? See you later.

198
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,568  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

199
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:55,091  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
What did Joey say? I like you back?

200
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:03,328  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

201
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,690  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
And you were hugging me...

202
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:10,892  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
...so obviously you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah!

203
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:15,485  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
- No?

204
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,967  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, here's the truth.

205
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,486  X1:177 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey said what he said...

206
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:27,891  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
...because I'm attracted to you.

207
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:30,282  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

208
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,886  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I admit it.

209
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:37,088  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
I have a crush on you. I know that's
crazy because we work together...

210
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,925  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and nothing could ever happen.

211
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,488  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
The last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

212
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:44,526  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
...or make you feel uncomfortable.

213
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:49,085  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which is why it would be great
if you said something right about now.

214
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,692  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

215
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:53,928  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

216
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,408  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
Right there. That's my car!

217
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,848  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey!
- Okay, that'll take one minute.

218
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,521  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you have anything else to say?

219
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:02,922  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe it.

220
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:06,802  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
We still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

221
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,884  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look, there they go.

222
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:13,086  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

223
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,882  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:524
Please, don't leave me.
I'll be lonely.

224
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:18,889  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop it. Stop.

225
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,682  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
- Yeah, okay.

226
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:28,407  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:524
Did you hear that?
She said, "Monica. "

227
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,887  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't leave her.

228
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:35,051  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:524
We could sneak the dog back
and Chandler wouldn't even know.

229
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,208  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:524
That won't work.

230
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,490  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
I've had that dog for three days,
and Chandler had no idea.

231
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,052  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's not so smart.

232
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,721  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey. I didn't know either.

233
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:48,085  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

234
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:49,972  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I knew.

235
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:56,848  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:488 Y2:524
Where's Chandler?

236
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,522  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Here I am.
- Wash your hands.

237
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:04,332  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
How did you know?

238
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,289  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, what's she doing back here?

239
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:13,291  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

240
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:18,129  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I laid out the states geographically.

241
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,484  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
We don't have time.
We have to keep Chandler away.

242
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,481  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah, but, look what...
- This is what we do not have time for!

243
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:33,090  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Where's Monica?
- In Phoebe's room. You can't go in.

244
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,488  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not?

245
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,805  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Monica's crying.

246
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,922  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

247
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,409  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Well, I should go in there.
- No, no.

248
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,690  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.

249
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:54,692  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why not?
- Because you sent away the dog.

250
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,047  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:524
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it? Is it?!

251
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:04,568  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

252
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:08,488  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

253
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:12,481  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
So Monica and her friend, Phyllis...

254
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:17,202  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:524
...take away the dog and that was the
last time we ever saw him. See?

255
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:20,086  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is just like that...

256
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:24,042  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
...only with a few details changed.

257
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,403  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

258
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:30,881  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
Bring on the food.

259
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:39,084  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's the matter?
- Monica's upset because of Klunkers.

260
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,409  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.

261
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:45,211  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that.

262
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:47,569  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:524
What if it attacks me?

263
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,688  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

264
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,809  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
And that doesn't scare you?

265
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,291  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, you need some help?

266
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,086  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:524
From you?

267
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:05,885  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, please.

268
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,489  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:486 Y2:524
First of all, Utah?

269
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,282  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

270
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,489  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:524
I hate America!

271
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:28,085  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
When I finish this game,
I swear I am moving.

272
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:33,086  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Tag still talking to the police?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,727  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
Dammit. Why did I open my mouth?

274
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,533  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you. "

275
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:40,809  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know that I freaked him out.

276
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,810  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
If you said it like that, you did.

277
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:46,882  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, is Chandler here?

278
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,368  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, he went for a walk.

279
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,928  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

280
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:55,972  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, no, no, no.

281
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,728  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.

282
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,606  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, no, the dog's not going
to be there!

283
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,482  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
You think?

284
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:09,803  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi, honey.

285
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:12,932  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:524
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

286
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,010  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What? Why would...?
- Wait and see.

287
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:17,408  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

288
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:21,803  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay, I went over to Ross'
to bring back Klunkers for you...

289
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:26,490  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

290
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:31,052  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

291
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:35,047  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

292
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:38,206  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:488 Y2:524
I couldn't find him...

293
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:42,207  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

294
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:46,810  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

295
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,411  X1:080 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
We have good news. Look who's back!

296
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:56,126  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:524
Klunkers. Oh, my God!

297
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,804  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
- She came back all by herself.
- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

298
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,882  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:524
It is so good to see you.

299
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,129  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:450 Y2:524
She came all the way back
from Ross'.

300
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,967  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
The things she must've seen.

301
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:12,251  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
She climbed up the fire escape...

302
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:17,009  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and tapped on the window with her
teeny paw, and we ran to let her in.

303
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,605  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:486 Y2:524
I went too far, didn't I?

304
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,404  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
When should I have stopped?

305
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:32,923  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, maybe this is so hard,
because there aren't 50 states.

306
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:38,009  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states...

307
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:40,204  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and there are no more!

308
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,326  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
I think I should be able
to eat something.

309
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:46,442  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's up to you.

310
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,811  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

311
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:56,891  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got to go to the police station
and look at mug shots.

312
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,242  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks for having me over.

313
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:00,609  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:524
Tag, you're going?

314
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:03,522  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
We didn't even get a chance to talk.

315
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:06,048  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
So where did you say
you're from again?

316
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,608  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Colorado.
- What good are you?

317
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,362  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I think we should talk
about what happened on the terrace.

318
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:19,801  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

319
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,845  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:488 Y2:524
I never should've said what I said.

320
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,323  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

321
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:27,929  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
We work together, so nothing could
ever happen between us.

322
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:32,849  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
I would love to go to work on Monday
and never talk about this again.

323
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:36,802  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay. Big day, Monday.
Lots to do.

324
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,327  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:524
So we okay?

325
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,603  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm not.

326
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,041  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:524
I freaked you out.

327
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,011  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, you didn't.

328
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:48,286  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing could happen between us.

329
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,488  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,732  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

331
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,447  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

332
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:29,492  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:524
Delaware.

333
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,486  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:052 Y2:088
Delaware.

334
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,091  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:131
- All right.
- I want my turkey now.

335
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,086  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:052 Y2:093
You got it.

336
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:47,089  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:052 Y2:093
You got Nevada twice.

337
