00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:08,321  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm ready.
- You sure?

2
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:11,172  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
Let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

3
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:14,887  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thanks, Daddy.
- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

4
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:19,410  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:524
- All right, it's all yours.
- Okay, okay.

5
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:21,330  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
There you go, there you go.

6
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:25,320  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.
This is so exciting!

7
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,409  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

8
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,001  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was my sixth birthday.
I went to the park...

9
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:33,522  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and I got on it and it bent.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:37,040  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I never had a bike of my own.
- What?

11
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:38,970  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
We didn't have a lot of money.

12
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,811  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

13
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:46,244  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was pink and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handles...

14
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:49,325  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and a bell
and this big, white wicker basket...

15
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:52,450  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
...with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

16
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:55,122  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
That sounds like my first bike.

17
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,250  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:524
My dad gave me his old one.

18
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:01,442  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
- No.

19
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,927  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

20
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:07,131  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

21
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:11,725  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
So I would sit on it and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

22
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:14,050  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:524
That is so unfair.

23
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:17,125  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
Not really, I got
to drag him around too.

24
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,008  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
The One With All the Candy

00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:01,644  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:052 Y2:093
Hey, what are you guys doing?

27
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,843  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:052 Y2:093
Making candy for the neighbors.

28
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,281  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, who?

29
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:08,763  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:052 Y2:127
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.

30
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,805  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:052 Y2:131
When the neighbors walk by,
they can take a piece.

31
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,288  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:052 Y2:127
- But we don't know the neighbors.
- I do.

32
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,529  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:052 Y2:132
There's, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

33
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:21,929  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:052 Y2:126
...smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

34
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:26,006  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:052 Y2:131
...and the red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

35
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,246  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:052 Y2:131
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

36
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,329  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:052 Y2:093
We can get to know our neighbors.

37
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:33,807  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wouldn't it be easier
if we just moved?

38
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,448  X1:247 X2:467 Y1:052 Y2:093
Good morning!

39
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:41,849  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:052 Y2:132
- Somebody's in a good mood.
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

40
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:44,930  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:052 Y2:131
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job...

41
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:48,044  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:052 Y2:131
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

42
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,367  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:052 Y2:094
It's not a big deal.

43
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:53,451  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:052 Y2:131
We stayed up creating a plan so
that us dating won't be a problem.

44
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,370  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

45
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,769  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:524
We... We are not...

46
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:04,563  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
...going to let it...

47
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:06,364  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:524
...be a problem.

48
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,330  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

49
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,841  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

50
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,127  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you two...?

51
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:17,800  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, I don't sleep with guys
on the first date.

52
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,526  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
- Anymore!

53
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:30,443  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Tag, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

54
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:33,564  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yes, at 4.
- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

55
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:35,241  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wait, wait.

56
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:40,601  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you see that?

57
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:43,804  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
He had no idea there was
something going on between us.

58
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:54,528  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'd better get back to my desk.
- Okay, hard worker.

59
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,363  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll put that in your evaluation.

60
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,525  X1:083 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:524
- My what?
- You've been here for two months now.

61
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:05,247  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
And your boss is required to hand in
a performance evaluation.

62
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:09,161  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

63
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:19,566  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you serious?
- No, but I've always wanted to do that.

64
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:21,964  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you help me clean this up?

65
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:30,644  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
The basket is totally empty!
The neighbors ate it all!

66
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:32,251  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, either that or... .

67
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:35,761  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey!

68
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:38,881  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah?

69
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,084  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
- That was the plan.

70
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:45,409  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
When I got to it,
there was only a few pieces left.

71
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:47,648  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
They've come by all day.
They love it.

72
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:50,362  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
They love my candy?

73
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:53,490  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
- Hey, Mon.

74
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:58,447  X1:070 X2:646 Y1:446 Y2:524
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.

75
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,402  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

76
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,125  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Mine stole my newspaper.

77
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:04,845  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's like a crime wave.

78
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,922  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:524
Pheebs, you got a second?

79
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:12,247  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

80
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,361  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:524
Ever since you told me
about that bike...

81
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,682  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.

82
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:21,441  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So... .

83
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:27,851  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, Ross!

84
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:29,884  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You like it?
- I love it!

85
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:32,282  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Yeah?
- Oh, oh, God...

86
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,443  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I love you.

87
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,251  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:524
Not that way.

88
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:38,962  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
But the bike got you a lot closer.

89
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,330  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, take it downstairs.

90
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,284  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know, give it a test drive.

91
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:45,562  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Oh, my God.

92
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,843  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:524
My first bike!

93
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:51,010  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

94
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,045  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're welcome.

95
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:57,322  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

96
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:00,646  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:524
Am not.

97
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,201  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:524
Who is that?

98
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,451  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't worry, I'm brave.

99
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,882  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
l... I am brave.

100
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,090  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, no, no, no!

101
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,482  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you tell me who is there, please?

102
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,092  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

103
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:24,560  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi.

104
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:27,889  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's candy time.

105
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:31,644  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
My roommate says they taste
like little drops of heaven.

106
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,649  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, please.

107
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,691  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven. "

108
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:39,691  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:524
Four a.m.

109
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,002  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
So can I get some candy?

110
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:46,291  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

111
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,889  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
He does not know
that I am not "some of us. "

112
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:54,810  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
in the morning.

113
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,287  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, I'll swing by later.

114
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,284  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
You live in this building?

115
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,249  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Seems like I'd remember you.

116
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,084  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Night, Gar.

117
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,202  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
So did you read your evaluation yet?

118
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:23,687  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, it was marked "confidential. "

119
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:25,843  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just sent it to human resources.

120
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:32,841  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
Please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

121
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,804  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
A joke they would appreciate?

122
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,287  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm thinking, no.

123
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:42,130  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What did you say?
- I said you were a good kisser...

124
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:46,484  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and that I liked your
teeny, tiny tushy.

125
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:49,528  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, not my tushy.

126
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:50,801  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
It gets worse.

127
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,048  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:524
About your initiative, I wrote:

128
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:56,449  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:524
"He was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision. "

129
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:02,083  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
Under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not. "

130
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:06,565  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
And then... And then I drew
a little smiley face.

131
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:09,844  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:484 Y2:524
And then a small pornographic sketch.

132
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,570  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
That is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

133
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:23,967  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
When I heard the story,
I almost cried.

134
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:25,605  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:486 Y2:524
Almost cried, huh?

135
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,082  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:486 Y2:524
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

136
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,409  X1:147 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about <i>Titanic. </i>

137
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:35,081  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Those two had only each other.

138
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,565  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
She really likes it, huh?

139
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,240  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street.

140
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,410  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

141
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:46,291  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
I saw her this morning,
walking it by the park.

142
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,088  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait, she was walking the bike?

143
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,884  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
Both times?

144
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,208  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Oh, hi!

145
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,081  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
- Oh, uh-huh, so much.

146
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:03,641  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
Pheebs, you do know how
to ride a bike, don't you?

147
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,885  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
Of course.

148
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:09,931  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can we see you ride it?

149
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:11,685  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

150
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:26,971  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:524
See?

151
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,925  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
I told you not to get
involved with your assistant.

152
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:40,363  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.

153
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:43,243  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you hear that, Chandler?

154
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:45,331  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
No such thing.

155
00:09:46,932 --> 00:09:49,526  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:524
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

156
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,927  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
not take it the way I meant it.

157
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:58,681  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

158
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,365  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and good worker.

159
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,123  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just gotta get the thing back.

160
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:06,209  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

161
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,926  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:524
Might it have looked
a little like this?

162
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,004  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, Joey!

163
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:15,041  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What is the matter with you?
- God!

164
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:20,451  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
This little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

165
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:29,650  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
after hours, but I really need candy.

166
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:33,004  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

167
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:36,090  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

168
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:39,045  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I told them all about your candy.
- You're kidding.

169
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:42,164  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
Out-of-towners, huh?
What did you tell them?

170
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,648  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

171
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:50,647  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
Some people have said it's "little
drops of heaven. " But whatever.

172
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:55,000  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Please, can't you help me out?
- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

173
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:59,091  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

174
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,408  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, I'll do it just this once.

175
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:04,729  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:524
- But you can't tell anyone.
- Please, just give it to me.

176
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,002  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, that's her.

177
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:09,723  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable!

178
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:12,241  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

179
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,330  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

180
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:17,486  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:524
But they like it.

181
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,645  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
You mean they like you.

182
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:21,887  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe.

183
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:25,369  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is that why you became a chef,
so people would like you?

184
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:29,485  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

185
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:41,889  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just remember everything
I taught you and you'll be fine.

186
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,764  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay? Here we go.

187
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,803  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ready, set...

188
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,810  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait, this seat
is really uncomfortable.

189
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:52,044  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

190
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,528  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair!

191
00:11:56,412 --> 00:12:00,405  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:524
You can't get out of this.
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

192
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:03,410  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why? Why do I have to learn?

193
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:08,570  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Well, in case of an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

194
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:13,050  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

195
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:15,812  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:524
"You ride this bike or I'll...

196
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:18,401  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll shoot you. "

197
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,042  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
I would ring the bell to distract him.

198
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:24,767  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then I would knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.

199
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:29,009  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

200
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:32,881  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

201
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,645  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
You won't let go?

202
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,080  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No.
- You swear?

203
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,486  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:524
I swear.

204
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,004  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay.
- Come on.

205
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,405  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here we go. All right?

206
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:47,601  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right?

207
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,723  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

208
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:52,969  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

209
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,367  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, yes, yes!

210
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,409  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no!

211
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,320  X1:269 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:524
You swore!

212
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:07,003  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I just thought you were doing so well.
- I am shocked. Shocked!

213
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,801  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a legitimate learning technique.

214
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,206  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

215
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:28,610  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hey, there's some people outside
asking about candy.

216
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:32,009  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
They'll just have to wait, okay?
I only got two hands!

217
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:35,410  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Need some help?
- No, you don't know the system.

218
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:38,001  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't need nobody messing
with the system!

219
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:42,725  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a lot of me.

220
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,564  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, hello, liar.

221
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:00,767  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
Look, I'm really sorry
I let go of the bike.

222
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,928  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
I could've been killed, you know.

223
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,530  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
I know, I know.

224
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,248  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
But can we please try it again?

225
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,722  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

226
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,400  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, I would love to...

227
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:19,249  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

228
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,640  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Phoebe.
- What?

229
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:31,409  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
What the hell?

230
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:33,841  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
You know what?

231
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,044  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you won't learn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...

232
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,208  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
...I have to take it back.
- But why?

233
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:42,602  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:488 Y2:524
Because it's... .

234
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:46,723  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
It'd be like you having this guitar...

235
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,650  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and never playing it.

236
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:51,645  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

237
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,850  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:488 Y2:524
And this bike wants to be ridden.

238
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,242  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
And if you don't ride it...

239
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:01,371  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
...you're killing its spirit.

240
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,520  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
The bike...

241
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,010  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:524
...is dying.

242
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:15,204  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

243
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,011  X1:303 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:524
Great.

244
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,448  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're making the bike very happy.

245
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:22,846  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Ross.

246
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,404  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
Please don't die!

247
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,241  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
To get the evaluation
before they see it...

248
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:37,809  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
...we gotta get into Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10.

249
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:41,891  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
But his assistant, Betty, comes in
early to eat breakfast at her desk.

250
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:45,209  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

251
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,207  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which is why I believe I can lure
her away with these chocolates.

252
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,683  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
While I distract her, you go in.

253
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,211  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Got it.
- Let's roll.

254
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:57,968  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?

255
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:01,369  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

256
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:03,324  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, great.

257
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:05,085  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:524
Abort the plan.

258
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:08,412  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
Actually, I'd like to speak
to both of you.

259
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:10,001  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

260
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:15,370  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.

261
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,491  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

262
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:24,006  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, I read your evaluation of Tag.

263
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,449  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
Or, to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

264
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:31,202  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is something going on with you two?

265
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:36,611  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

266
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:41,728  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, what would happen exactly?

267
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,241  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

268
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,046  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

269
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,403  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

270
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,005  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Well...
- Mr. Zelner... .

271
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,762  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:524
I filled in that evaluation.

272
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,246  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, no...
- Yeah, yeah.

273
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:00,403  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought it would be funny.

274
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:04,405  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:484 Y2:524
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

275
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,881  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

276
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,447  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:488 Y2:524
I have a weird sense of humor.

277
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:12,081  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

278
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,608  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

279
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:18,806  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:446 Y2:524
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.

280
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:22,209  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's upside down, you gotta...
It doesn't matter.

281
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,961  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's not like I don't have
a sense of humor.

282
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,608  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hell, I even enjoy a
naughty limerick every now and then.

283
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:33,690  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's a time and a place.

284
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,206  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
Unless you have a limerick right now.

285
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,287  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
No? Okay.
Well, you've got my fax number.

286
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:54,480  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
I can't believe you did that.
That was sweet.

287
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,445  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Don't worry about it.
- You could've lost your job.

288
00:17:57,692 --> 00:18:00,764  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:524
Are you kidding me? With this
cute butt, I'd find work.

289
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:04,769  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you, you're great.

290
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,603  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You know what?
- What?

291
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:10,610  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:524
I feel great.

292
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:13,009  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:524
In fact... .

293
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:18,521  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

294
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:22,921  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's just... It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

295
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,010  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:27,923  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
There it is.

297
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:40,481  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
What is going on?

298
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:43,923  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy!

299
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:46,407  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, lady, give us candy.

300
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:48,881  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey!

301
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:51,842  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's up, buddy?
- What are you doing?

302
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,005  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
Waiting to get candy.

303
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,204  X1:266 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
Get in here.

304
00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:00,802  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

305
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,491  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas.

306
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:10,691  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:524
The candy is coming! I need
another 15 minutes for it to cool.

307
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:16,609  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!

308
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,848  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
What is the matter with you people?

309
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:22,044  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
This woman was trying to do a nice
thing for you.

310
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:25,562  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
She was making candy
so she could get to know all of you...

311
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:29,082  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

312
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,691  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Am I right?

313
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:33,169  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:524
Candy Lady?

314
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,642  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, not "Candy Lady. "

315
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,647  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
If we know it, can we have candy?

316
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,444  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, you know what?

317
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:45,088  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
Forget it, you've ruined it.

318
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,248  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go home. You've ruined it.

319
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,047  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's all wrong! You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it!

320
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,046  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

321
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,081  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you smoke?

322
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:08,931  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

323
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,211  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you okay?

324
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,926  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
Fine, but it was
really scary for a while.

325
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:17,090  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
Someone slipped a threatening
note under the door!

326
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:21,046  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever.

327
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:34,084  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:052 Y2:127
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike!

328
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,284  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:132
I never thought I'd be able
to do that. Thank you.

329
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,722  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:052 Y2:132
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

330
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:43,607  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:052 Y2:132
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

331
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:47,521  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:052 Y2:132
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.
