1
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,321
Hey.

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:08,565
-What's the matter?
-Someone on the subway licked my neck!

3
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:10,808
Willy's still alive!

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,683
-What are you doing?
-My mom called.

5
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:16,008
They're announcing
our engagement in the paper.

6
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:20,325
-We're looking for a good picture.
-I'm afraid that does not exist.

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:22,930
There are great pictures of us.

8
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:27,205
No, there are great pictures of you
next to a guy who's going like this. . . .

9
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:32,725
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

10
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:37,004
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

11
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:38,361
MONICA:
Here's a great one.

12
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,611
-Yeah, I'm not in that.
-No, but look at me, all tan.

13
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:46,208
Why don't you get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

14
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:50,047
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,961
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

16
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:00,847
-Chandler, what do you say?
-All right, but I'm not going.

17
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,810
"I'm" going.

18
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:05,608

20
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,648
Dude, that reverse lay-up.

21
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,002
-And how about those three-pointers?
-Amazing.

22
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:47,966
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

23
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:55,167
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

24
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:59,968
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees. "

25
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,569
Yes, and we call Ross
"Lingers in the Bathroom. "

26
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:07,922
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees"
just asked me out.

27
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,404
-I thought that guy was married.
-He's getting divorced.

28
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:14,244
Ross, maybe you know him.

29
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,570
It's not a club.

30
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,569
If he's getting a divorce,
is it a good idea to date him?

31
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:27,330
-Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
-That's on the napkins at the club.

32
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:32,362
-I gotta go to work.
-You don't have to go for a half-hour.

33
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:35,968
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch.

34
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,171
I could just spread him on a cracker.

35
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:44,367
Rach, why would you hire this guy?

36
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:47,370
-You know you can't date him, right?
-I know that.

37
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:50,410
We joked that we spend
so much time together. . .

38
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:52,244
. . .he should call me his "work-wife. "

39
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:56,446
Soon he'll be able to call you "that
lady he knew that got fired. "

40
00:02:57,172 --> 00:03:00,164
I won't get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.

41
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,522
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone?

42
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:07,169
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

43
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,766
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

44
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:13,328
Dude, that's so sad.

45
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,485
I could put a basketball court
in the back.

46
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:18,320
Could I play?

47
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,646
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

48
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:30,329
-I just did them.
-Well, drop and give me 1 0 more.

49
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,811
What?

50
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,889
I had a drink with lunch.

51
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,563
-Did those cost reports come in?
-I did them last night.

52
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:41,530
Could you make me 4 copies?

53
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:43,484
-Sure.
-Great, thank you.

54
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:55,967
Huh.

55
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:00,761
Oh.

56
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:06,170
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi, Melissa. What's up?

57
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:10,251
I'm just about to go out to the store.

58
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:13,012
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

59
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,885
Dried fruit and granola,
and stuff like that.

60
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,929
-What's up?
-Is Tag here?

61
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,121
No. Why?

62
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,721
I was gonna talk to him about tonight.

63
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:26,050
Really? You got a little crush
on Tag there, do ya?

64
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,962
We've been flirting back and forth. . .

65
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:33,051
. . .but I was hoping tonight it would
turn into something a little more.

66
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:36,164
Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

67
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:43,847
But you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

68
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,482
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

69
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,283
All right, back to work.

70
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:52,161
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

71
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:58,247
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.

72
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:08,082
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

73
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:11,081
Now, Chandler, you want to
give us a smile?

74
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,486
Okay.

75
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:19,088
-I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
-No, I am.

76
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:22,723
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

77
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,042
-I do?
-Yeah.

78
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,687
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.

79
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:33,282
-Try looking sexy.
-Okay.

80
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,251
Or not.

81
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,287
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

82
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:52,087
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce on my shirt.

83
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:56,290
-You got an extra one?
-Yeah, sure.

84
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,087
Here.

85
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:01,651
Great.

86
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,881
You got anything that's
not Ralph Lauren?

87
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,370
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

88
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:11,851
I guess this'll be fine.

89
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:15,243
-What are you doing tonight?
-Nothing. Why?

90
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,529
How would you feel about
taking out Tag? I'll pay.

91
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:23,690
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

92
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,930
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

93
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:30,970
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

94
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,521
He's new in town and
he doesn't have any guy friends.

95
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,650
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.

96
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,929
-Yeah, okay, no problem.
-Thank you.

97
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:43,481
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!

98
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,285
I know. Let's try a look. . .

99
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:56,762
. . .of far-off wonderment.

100
00:06:57,052 --> 00:07:02,285
Gaze into our future and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

101
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,849
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

102
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:13,885
This picture should say
"Geller and Bing to be married" . . .

103
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:17,050
. . .not "Local woman saves
drowning moron. "

104
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:18,448
(LAUGHS)

105
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:22,247
Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.

106
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,448
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!

107
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,087
I like this one.

108
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:35,967
It seems to say, "I love you and
that's why I have to kill you. "

109
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,765
Can't all be bad.

110
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:43,051
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

111
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,407
There it is.

112
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,843
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

113
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,682
Why did you ever sleep with me?

114
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,286
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

115
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:00,688
-I'm having a good time.
-Me too.

116
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,645
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

117
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:07,242
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

118
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:09,484
I don't mean to be presumptuous. . .

119
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:12,604
. . .but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

120
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:14,451
Yeah, l--

121
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:18,731
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

122
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,724
I know it's lame, but I got
these tickets from my boss--

123
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:25,486
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

124
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,728
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

125
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:29,885
It's my ex-wife, Whitney.

126
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:32,930
I cannot deal with her now.
She's crazy.

127
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:34,645
Okay, I know. Hold on.

128
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,205
-Hey, Ross.
-Yeah.

129
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:40,650
That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife
out there.

130
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:44,367
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

131
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,523
What? No.

132
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:51,451
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the ballroom-dance finals.

133
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,451
I don't think so, Pheebs.

134
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,085
All right, I'll do it.

135
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,849
-But just because you're a friend.
-Okay.

136
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,567
Oh!

137
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,084
Hi, Ginger.

138
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,850
I want my key back.

139
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:22,441
-I don't have it.
-It's right there.

140
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:24,851
Okay, Sherlock.

141
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,688
I'm sorry, but you'd better go.

142
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:30,924
I just wanted to thank you
for diverting Kyle's ex.

143
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:33,930
You're welcome.
We'll talk about it later.

144
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,445
-Hi, Whitney.
-Hi, Ross.

145
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,048
-Are you ready for breakfast?
-Yep.

146
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,251
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

147
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:51,523
Can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman. . .

148
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,007
. . .who, by the way, did not
spend the night?

149
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,963
-Sure.
-Okay.

150
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,847
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

151
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,565
Watching ballroom dancing?

152
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,730
Yes, that's where we realized
we were both super cool people.

153
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:12,806
Look, Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

154
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:13,888
Like what?

155
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:17,801
Like she's really mean, and
she's overly critical and--

156
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:22,842
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

157
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:25,726
Okay.

158
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:29,090
And she uses sex as a weapon.

159
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,651
Thank you for warning me.

160
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:35,562
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for
room painting and sex weapons.

161
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,286
-You're still gonna go out with her?
-Yeah.

162
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:41,841
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

163
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:44,965
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

164
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,966
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.

165
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,367
Listen to me, she is crazy!

166
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,250
WHITNEY:
Your door isn't soundproof.

167
00:10:57,172 --> 00:11:00,084
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

168
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,924
-Morning.
-Hi, Tag.

169
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:10,489
-Did you have fun with Joey?
-Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

170
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:12,326
That's nice.

171
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:15,968
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

172
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,964
Women? You mean, like old women?

173
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:24,808
Kind of old, like 30.

174
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:34,124
I never used to be able
to talk to girls in bars. . .

175
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,444
. . .but I got like 20 phone numbers
last night.

176
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:41,722
That's great.

177
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:44,321
Joey must have really taught
you some stuff.

178
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,601
A little.

179
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:48,725
How you doing?

180
00:11:55,892 --> 00:12:00,329
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

181
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,290
Now pretend I have a camera.

182
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:06,606
-You're changing it.
-I can't help it.

183
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,128
You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

184
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,203
Borrow money from me?

185
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:17,843
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

186
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:22,404
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

187
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:24,011
Then I look up.

188
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,125
See? Now you try.

189
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,449
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

190
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,648
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

191
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,845
I had a donut.

192
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,285
-Hi.
-Hey.

193
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,529
So, I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

194
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:43,926
Yeah, that guy's all right.

195
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:48,085
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey. "

196
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,043
-What?
-You know, all the women.

197
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:54,005
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

198
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:56,607
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

199
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,008
I'm right here.

200
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:08,410
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

201
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:11,809
Just the idea of you and he
and all these women--

202
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,321
I know he's my assistant,
and we can't date!

203
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,210
But it bothers me, all right?

204
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:19,006
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

205
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:22,807
I got a great partner to pick
up girls with. Finally!

206
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:29,008
I'm still right here.

207
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:31,245
Will you talk to him. . .

208
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:35,849
. . .and tell him how unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

209
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:38,006
What?

210
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:42,648
I don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

211
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:44,041
I will get over it.

212
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:47,045
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.

213
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,967
I get these crushes all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.

214
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,010
I know. Monica told me.

215
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,808
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?

216
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:00,846
Yeah, sure.

217
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:07,001
Can you people not see me?

218
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,451
Will you talk to him?

219
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:15,327
-I don't know, Rach.
-I'll give you 1 0 Ralph Lauren shirts.

220
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:16,840
One.

221
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,560
No, 1 0. You said 1 0.
You can't take that back.

222
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:28,805
You wanted to talk to me?

223
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,208
I don't know.
You got something for me?

224
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,965
Yeah, this is from Rachel.

225
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,811
Ten. Okay.

226
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,202
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

227
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:44,002
-Really?
-Yeah, for you.

228
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,882
-Hey, there you are.
-There I am.

229
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:55,482
-You okay?
-Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.

230
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:57,404
So he gave me an antihistamine.

231
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,081
What?

232
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,726
I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

233
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:04,361
Brooklyn is far.

234
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:06,646
What were you thinking?

235
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:10,367
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

236
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,329
Okay, see. Look down.

237
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,290
Look down.

238
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,490
Look down.

239
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:25,690
-Chandler?
-Yeah?

240
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,482
-Hi.
-Hi.

241
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:37,571
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

242
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:41,683
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

243
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:45,402
FYl, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples. . .

244
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,165
. . .before she painted that room.

245
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:53,168
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass. "

246
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:56,530
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating. . .

247
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,967
. . .and a little more time
in the bedroom.

248
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,881
I don't think we are going
to have that problem. . .

249
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:05,886
. . .but maybe it's because I am not
emotionally unavailable.

250
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:08,490
You think he's
emotionally unavailable?

251
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,683
I think he can be.

252
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:12,721
Maybe he wouldn't be. . .

253
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,247
. . .if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

254
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:18,649
Excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

255
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,891
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve 1 997.

256
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:26,883
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!

257
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:30,801
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

258
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,287
What more do you want?!

259
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,927
We want the last 6 years back!

260
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,885
So do we! So do we!

261
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,488
I'm sorry you had to see that.

262
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:50,929
-Morning, Rachel.
-Hi.

263
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,242
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?

264
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,164
-Went out with Joey.
-Yeah?

265
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:58,882
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?

266
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,046
No, we had a really good talk.

267
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:05,841
I don't think I'll do
the bar scene anymore.

268
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:08,885
Wow, I did not see that coming.

269
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,284
It's just not really who I am.

270
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:15,405
I've always been happier when--
Why am I telling you this?

271
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:18,001
-You don't care about this stuff.
-Yes, I do.

272
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:22,405
You were saying,
"I'm happier when l. . . . "

273
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,091
When I'm in a relationship.

274
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:26,482
-I love having a girlfriend.
-Really?

275
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,804
Someone I can spoil, you know.

276
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,883
Spoil?

277
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,362
-Let me ask you something.
-Uh-huh?

278
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:38,370
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

279
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,889
I'm starting to.

280
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:44,730
And if that person's in your life
you should do something about it?

281
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,490
Yes. Hell, yes.

282
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:48,889
-All right, then, it's settled.
-Okay.

283
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:52,209
-I'm getting back together with my ex.
-I would love to!

284
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:53,881
What?

285
00:17:58,092 --> 00:17:59,491
Hello?

286
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:03,489
Oh. This is gonna be a while.
Excuse me.

287
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,091
Yeah.

288
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,690
(PHOEBE TAPS SPOON)

289
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,127
My God!

290
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,129
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

291
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:27,170
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

292
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,605
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed. . .

293
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,485
. . .if someone else knew where
everything was.

294
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,327
Oh, he knows.

295
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:39,085
For the most part.

296
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,640
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.

297
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,690
We kind of need to talk.

298
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,042
-Both of you together?
-What's up?

299
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:52,285
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things. . .

300
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:55,131
. . .and we got to reminiscing.

301
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:56,890
KYLE:
We talked most of the night. . .

302
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:59,401
. . .and realized the reason
we're angry with each other. . .

303
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:03,491
. . .is because there are still
feelings there.

304
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,080
So. . . .

305
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,164
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

306
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,526
We're gonna try again.

307
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,642
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

308
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:19,967
I'll work on that.

309
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:22,367
Right, because you're so
capable of change.

310
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,888
You know, he hums when he pees.

311
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:31,890
-I do know.
-Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

312
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,769
We're so sorry.

313
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:39,200
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

314
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,484
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

315
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,690
Yeah, we're gonna go.

316
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,284
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,689
Pheebs, you were right about her.

318
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,481
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

319
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,728
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

320
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:07,010
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

321
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:11,885
We're better off without them.

322
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:16,725
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

323
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:20,083
-Divorced men's club.
-Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

324
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:26,921
Hey, guys, check it out.

325
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:30,482
-My mom sent me the paper.
-Let's see it.

326
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:35,890
-Oh, yeah, that looks good.
-You make a very attractive couple.

327
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:42,208
-Yeah, we look great together.
-We really do.

328
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,091
Okay.

329
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:46,728
Imagine what our kids would look like.

330
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:48,445
We don't have to imagine.

331
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,011
I'm marrying her.

332
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,850
We'll just see.
