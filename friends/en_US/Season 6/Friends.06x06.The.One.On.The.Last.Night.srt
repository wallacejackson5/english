1
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:12,355
I'm moving out, so you're
in charge of paying the rent.

2
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:14,716
-When's it due?
-On the first.

3
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:16,427
And that's every month?

4
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:19,392
No, just the months
you want to live here.

5
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:22,935
Okay, here's the phone bill.

6
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:25,695
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,771
That's our phone number.

8
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:33,440
I know I kind of sprung this
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

9
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:37,239
-Why don't I cover you for a while?
-No way!

10
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:40,647
Joey Tribbiani does not
take charity...

11
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,581
...anymore.

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,421
-It's not charity, Joe.
-Forget it.

13
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:48,856
Thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

14
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:52,156
I can take care of myself.
What's next? Come on.

15
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:53,865
Here's the electric bill.

16
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:57,695
-This is how much we pay for electric?
-Well, yeah.

17
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:04,272
So we'll do
the rest of the bills later, then?

18
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,210
The One On The Last Night

19
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:45,081
Will Joey have to give up
the apartment?

20
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:47,580
I offered him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

21
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:49,287
How much does he need?

22
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,991
$ 1500 would cover him
for a few months...

23
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:56,025
...but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

24
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,254
Why don't you hire him as an actor?

25
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:03,493
You could have him dress up
and put on skits whenever you want.

26
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,999
Well, that would help the pride thing.

27
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:14,479
Wow, you look great! Do you wanna
move in with me tomorrow?

28
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:19,308
Any plans for tonight?

29
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:22,054
Instead of being sad on my
last night with Rachel...

30
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,225
...we're going out to celebrate
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

31
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:29,689
-And also my birthday.
-It's not your birthday.

32
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:35,200
What a mean thing to say! I'd never
tell you it wasn't your birthday.

33
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:41,039
You guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

34
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:45,039
Instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

35
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:51,250
Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.

36
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,782
I don't know, Ross.

37
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,954
Not if you talk about how you gave up
basketball to become a paleontologist.

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,752
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist!

39
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:04,690
-Pheebs--
-You're not dressed yet?

40
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,627
We're supposed to start having fun
in 15 minutes!

41
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:11,627
And clearly, not a minute sooner.

42
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:16,035
You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?

43
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:19,473
Of course I'm packed.
Monica, relax.

44
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,079
I wanted to ask Phoebe
what I should wear.

45
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:24,875
My God, I can't get a minute of peace.

46
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,519
Oh, my God!

47
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,824
Monica's just gonna kill you.

48
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,255
I know.

49
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,522
What you're wearing is fine
for that.

50
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:44,527
You're not packed!

51
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:47,506
You're not packed even a little bit!

52
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:49,937
Surprise!

53
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,207
Don't get mad,
because this is what happened.

54
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:57,950
I started packing,
then I realized, "What am I doing?"

55
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,881
I am lousy at packing, right?

56
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,820
But you love packing!

57
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:06,991
So as a gift to you
on our last night....

58
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,594
I'll be coordinator!

59
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,200
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

60
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:20,196
Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?

61
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:21,770
I have plans.

62
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:24,675
-You have plans with us.
-That's right.

63
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:29,111
Chandler can make boxes, Ross can
wrap and Joey can lift.

64
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,475
Tell the guys
they have to help out.

65
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,515
My God, thank you!

66
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:37,356
Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!

67
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:40,990
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves!

68
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,527
The movers will be here in 11 hours.
Rachel hasn't packed.

69
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,734
Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler--

70
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,867
I have plans with Joey.

71
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:55,732
-You said you were doing nothing.
-Yes, but for the last time.

72
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,875
Fine. Now, Ross--

73
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,512
-I can't do it.
-Why not?

74
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:05,149
-Don't you have Ben?
-Because I have Ben!

75
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,779
It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?

76
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,421
He's at a dinner party.

77
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,554
He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.

78
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,024
Of course he is. What?

79
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,824
You think I'd use my son as an excuse?

80
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,400
What kind of father do you think I am?

81
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,162
All right. Sorry.

82
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:28,364
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

83
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:34,002
Here it is.

84
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,739
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

85
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,384
I wish I knew that.
I ordered Chinese.

86
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,280
Well, that's okay.

87
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:43,920
In a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

88
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:48,093
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...

89
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,556
...you, the food of yours!

90
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,963
I had an idea for what to do
on our last night.

91
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:01,106
What do you say we play a little
foosball for money?

92
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:05,277
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

93
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:09,242
-It'd be easier to give me your money.
-Yes, it would.

94
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,340
What do you say to $50?

95
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:17,787
I say to it:
"50 dollars, you are more than I have."

96
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,120
If you know that you'll win,
what difference does it make?

97
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,387
-You're on.
-Okay, let's play.

98
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,496
The big game. Italy versus...

99
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,289
...China, apparently.

100
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,567
Look, it's the Rollerblades.

101
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,274
Oh, God!

102
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,642
You remember when we got these?

103
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:43,306
I guess you weren't there.

104
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:47,918
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

105
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:50,951
Come on. Hey, remember the time....

106
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,786
You don't remember?

107
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:02,232
Sorry, Pheebs. I'm just really sad
that I'm leaving.

108
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,266
I'm gonna miss you so much.

109
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:07,769
This doesn't have to be so sad,
though, you know?

110
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:11,101
Instead of thinking about
how you'll miss each other...

111
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:15,077
...you should think of the things
you're not gonna miss.

112
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,778
I don't think there's anything.

113
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:20,248
Come on, there's gotta be something.

114
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:23,417
She's perfect.

115
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:27,887
I have one.

116
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:31,488
Okay, you can go first.

117
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,029
I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...

118
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,327
...that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen.

119
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,500
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

120
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:47,008
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

121
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:49,806
Sometimes.

122
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,415
Always, actually.

123
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,651
There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

124
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,225
Not just the phone pen.

125
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,453
I never get my messages.

126
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,221
You get your messages.

127
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:08,626
It doesn't count if you have to
read them off your hand...

128
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:11,735
...after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

129
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:14,531
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

130
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,206
Or your mom?

131
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,375
Or Chandler?

132
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:19,738
Or your mom?

133
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,580
It worked! No one's sad!

134
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:30,756
I win again!

135
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:33,958
That's, like, 500 bucks
you owe me!

136
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:36,559
Man! Five hundred dollars.

137
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,026
That is a lot of electricity, huh?

138
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,763
I gotta buy some food.

139
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:46,470
Give me a chance to win my money back.
Sudden death...

140
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:49,435
...one goal, $ 1000.

141
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:51,533
-You serious?
-Yes!

142
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,076
Get ready to owe me.

143
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:56,612
Here we go. Ready?

144
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,398
No...

145
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,805
...one can beat me!

146
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:34,250
That's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

147
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,360
Hi, Ross.
See, other people call me!

148
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,292
Oh, your brother. Score!

149
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,131
What's up?

150
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:50,597
<i>I'm here with Ben.</i>

151
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,428
Thought we'd say hi.

152
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:56,199
-Put him on.
-Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

153
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,706
I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

154
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,439
He's smiling, though.

155
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:07,542
Okay, talk to you later.

156
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:18,453
You know, Daddy was gonna be
a basketball player.

157
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:27,062
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

158
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,774
Hey, remember the Rollerblades?

159
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:35,080
You know what else I won't miss?
"I'm Monica.

160
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,716
I wash the toilets 17 times a day,
even if people are on it!"

161
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,648
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight?

162
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,356
I'd better wash it and shrink it!"

163
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,786
"I'm Monica. I never get messages
from interesting people."

164
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,793
I call her.

165
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:57,830
"Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate
Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross!"

166
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:00,935
"My God!
I can't find a boyfriend.

167
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:05,268
I'll stumble across the hall and sleep
with the first guy I find there!"

168
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,879
You guys, come on,
this is the last night!

169
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,815
Yeah, you're right, and so for the last time
I would like to ask you:

170
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,420
Boo-hoo. Get out of my room!

171
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:26,225
We should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

172
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,798
Still broken?

173
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,067
It sucks, man.

174
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,108
Your last night, and I lose the two
most important things:

175
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,475
The foosball table...

176
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:45,512
...and $500.

177
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:50,483
There are other ways to win back
your money. How about blackjack?

178
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,052
Not my game.

179
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,826
You know what?
We can play a new game.

180
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,391
-It's fun!
-What's it called?

181
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,298
Cups.

182
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:05,235
-I don't know how.
-I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.

183
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,303
-All right.
-Here you go.

184
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,775
I have two queens.
What do you have?

185
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,507
-A 2 and a 5.
-You win! Fifty dollars!

186
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,246
-Really?
-Let's play again.

187
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,353
-What have you got?
-4 and a 9.

188
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,447
You're kidding, right?

189
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,127
-No. Why?
-That's a full cup!

190
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:34,292
Damn, I am good at Cups!

191
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:38,192
I'm not talking to her.

192
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:41,029
You have to take the first step...

193
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:44,708
...because she's the one who's
leaving. It's harder for her.

194
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,239
Maybe you're right.

195
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,913
But she made fun of my phone pen!

196
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,877
I know. I took it hard too.

197
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,579
She's in there right now, crying.
I can hear her.

198
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,417
She's not crying.

199
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:06,395
She's holding it in.
She's so brave. Go.

200
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,500
I feel bad about what happened--

201
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,228
-What are you doing?
-I'm unpacking.

202
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,269
I'm not moving.
Is that picture straight?

203
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:21,342
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

204
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:25,550
You're the one who wants this
big change and to move in with Chandler!

205
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,776
You should go!
Why do I have to leave?

206
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:31,750
-It's my apartment!
-It's mine too! What else you got?

207
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,617
How about: You're moving!

208
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:46,836
This is ridiculous.

209
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:50,571
We should be packing you!

210
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,437
-Hey, how you guys doing?
-Great. Monica's moving.

211
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,007
I am not!

212
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:01,309
Really? How come all your
stuff is in this box?

213
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:05,046
Okay, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here!

214
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,558
You guys? Stop!

215
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:12,923
I know you're acting mad because
it'll make it easier to leave.

216
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:16,226
But deep down, you're really sad.
Deep, deep down.

217
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,630
-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
-Well, deep down!

218
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,099
I'm just mad.

219
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,232
Then keep running.

220
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:26,734
You win!

221
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:29,004
-What did you have?
-Nothing beats...

222
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,514
...a three and a six.

223
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,412
That, my friend, is "D Cup."

224
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:39,022
How much have you won so far?

225
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,654
-700.
-Not 700 exactly?

226
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,158
Double it.

227
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:50,796
In Cups, once you get $ 700,
you have to double it.

228
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,540
I didn't make up the rules.

229
00:14:56,642 --> 00:15:00,544
Now, after you receive the doubling
bonus, you get one card.

230
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:05,341
That one card could be worth $ 100,
which brings your total to $ 1500.

231
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:11,323
Don't get excited, that won't happen
unless you get the-- No way!

232
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,519
This is the last box of your clothes.

233
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,721
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

234
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,728
I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

235
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:30,170
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but...

236
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,741
...I don't wanna live with
Rachel anymore.

237
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:35,511
You're so mean to each other.

238
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,980
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

239
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:42,482
That's fine because I'm not moving.

240
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,517
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

241
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,953
I said some bad stuff...

242
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:51,254
...but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

243
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,929
Like what, Monica?

244
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,468
She has 147,000 pair of boots.

245
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,365
Good start, Mon.

246
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,030
She lets you borrow them.

247
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,410
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

248
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,744
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold!

249
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:17,555
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

250
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:18,991
What else?

251
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,456
When I take a shower...

252
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:24,953
...she leaves me notes on the mirror.

253
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,425
I do. I do do that.

254
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,634
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

255
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,407
When I fall asleep on the couch...

256
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,574
...she covers me with a blanket.

257
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:43,641
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

258
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:50,781
And when I told her I was gonna
move in with Chandler...

259
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,853
...she was really supportive.

260
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:57,322
You were so great.

261
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,994
You made it so easy.

262
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,100
And now you have to leave.

263
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:08,072
And I have to live with a boy!

264
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,135
It's gonna be fine.

265
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,706
Now I can't wait to live with you!

266
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,709
You know what we should do?

267
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:22,910
Bring Monica, and we'll live together!
We'll have so much fun!

268
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,749
I think she's moving in with Chandler.

269
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:30,189
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?

270
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,322
Kind of.

271
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,632
Oh, my God!

272
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:48,045
How's the packing going?

273
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:52,139
Ben? He's fine. He's right--
Oh, my God!

274
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:56,883
Get your head out of your shirt
there, son!

275
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,860
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

276
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,766
-What's wrong?
-Ross and I were helping pack...

277
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:12,870
...took a little break.
I lost $ 1500 to him in Cups!

278
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,166
How did you lose at Cups?

279
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,041
The same way you lost!

280
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:23,771
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.

281
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,717
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.

282
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:31,118
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup...

283
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:36,555
...the sitting-down bonus. I didn't
even get half a cup! Nothing!

284
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:38,489
Oh, man!

285
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,256
He never played before either.

286
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:44,833
I think beginner's luck
is very important in Cups!

287
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,333
Let's play one more hand.
One more hand.

288
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,033
No more! I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

289
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:53,745
In fact, look.

290
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,776
I wanna give you something.

291
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,846
Let me give it to you before
I pawn it for Cups money.

292
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:05,648
I want you to have
the big, white dog...

293
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:09,688
...as a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

294
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,262
I can't take the big white dog.
You love it.

295
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:15,933
It's "him." Not "it."

296
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:19,463
What if I bought it from you?

297
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:22,903
Then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

298
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:24,870
Say $ 1500?

299
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:30,203
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

300
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,777
You're trying to give me money again!

301
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,918
When did I try to give you money?

302
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,950
Over there with the bills!

303
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:40,192
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

304
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,290
We had a nice last night together.

305
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:46,088
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

306
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:51,067
Now you start with the
charity thing again!

307
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:55,103
I'm trying to help you out.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

308
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,332
I will be okay.

309
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,512
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself.

310
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:05,909
I'm not gonna miss you helping me
out with money.

311
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,449
The only thing I'm gonna miss...

312
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:10,488
...is you.

313
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:14,692
And now the dog.

314
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:26,064
-Call me when you get there, okay?
-Okay.

315
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:27,965
I'm really gonna miss you.

316
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:37,045
I have your key.

317
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,144
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

318
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:49,984
God, this is silly.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

319
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:53,028
Bye, house.

320
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,891
-She really left.
-I know.

321
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,863
-Thank you.
-No problem, roomie.

322
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:44,381
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

323
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:47,313
What the hell is that dog doing here?

324
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:54,322
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

325
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,996
-And now you want that money back?
-Exactly.

326
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,561
What kind of idiot do you
take me for?

327
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,825
It's not a real game.
I made it up.

328
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:07,197
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

329
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,804
At a fake game!

330
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:12,504
If you wanna try to
make some of it back...

331
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:15,874
...I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

332
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:19,312
I am very good at Cups.

333
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:24,147
I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last.

334
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,891
Let's see if it comes up this time.
