1
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:04,011
Ready?

2
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:07,753
Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's.
Please...

3
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,649
-...leave--
-Leave.

4
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:12,589
But I just said "leave."

5
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,692
I know because you have
all the good words.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,623
What do I get? I get "it's," "and."
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a." Forget it.

7
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,926
-That's silly.
-All right. So let's switch.

8
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:26,398
No, I have all the good words.

9
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:28,966
Okay, fine, fine.
We can switch.

10
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:33,076
- Hi...
-...everybody...

11
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:34,302
-...it's...
-...Rachel...

12
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:35,503
-...and...
-...Phoebe's.

13
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,840
Wait. How did you do that?

14
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:39,518
What?

15
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:43,220
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,653
This is gonna be interesting.

17
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:50,390
Can we finish this later?
I'm going running before it gets dark.

18
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,094
-Why don't you come with me?
-Really?

19
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:58,100
It'll be fun! We'll run in the park.
It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.

20
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:59,772
Okay, let's go running!

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,372
-There's cute guys there.
-Let's run towards them!

22
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:05,974
Wait just one more second.

23
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,976
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

24
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:12,081
Wait a minute.
You took all the words!

25
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,913
You've met your match, Rachel Greene!

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,724
The One Where Phoebe Runs

27
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:56,992
I just finished this
fascinating book.

28
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,390
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers...

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,603
...that can carry out the same amount
of functions as a human brain.

30
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,998
So, theoretically,
you could download...

31
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,644
...your thoughts and memories
into this computer...

32
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:16,109
...and live forever as a machine.

33
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:24,121
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

34
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:31,995
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

35
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,534
-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
-So you can move them!

36
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:42,769
And while I'm doing that, Ross has
a great computer story for you.

37
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:48,013
Hey, everybody!
I'd like you to meet Janine.

38
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:50,216
She's gonna be my new roommate!

39
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:56,579
And she's gonna live with me!

40
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,289
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,754
Le Croix.

42
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:04,689
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

43
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,597
So where are you from?

44
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,836
Australia.
I just moved here.

45
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,503
From the land down under?

46
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,764
I didn't know that either!

47
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:16,667
So what do you do?

48
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,675
-I'm a dancer.
-You're a dancer?

49
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,913
She's a dancer!

50
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:26,517
I think I'll go unpack.

51
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,459
Did you interview her
before you asked her to move in?

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,267
Of course!

53
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:43,936
What did you ask her?

54
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:45,966
When can you move in?

55
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:51,409
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

56
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,678
Unbelievable.

57
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:55,140
Down, boy.

58
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:58,876
Oh, no, no, no. She's not my type.
Not for me, she's not my type. She's too--

59
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:02,215
Beautiful, tall, sexy,
showing her stomach?

60
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,051
Look at all the boxes!

61
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,223
I cannot wait to ask her out.

62
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:11,726
Wait a minute.
You can't. She's your roommate.

63
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,397
It'll be too complicated.

64
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,100
Yeah, don't do it.

65
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:18,701
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

66
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,004
What if you started going out with her
and it didn't work out?

67
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,939
That's when I make my move.

68
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,712
Remember when you broke up
with Donna...

69
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:32,181
...how horrible it was when you
bumped into her at the supermarket?

70
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:33,850
Oh, God, yeah.

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,680
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

72
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,117
Okay!

73
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,627
You're right! I don't want that.
I can't date her.

74
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:48,891
You'd better watch the flirting too,
because it could be trouble.

75
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,998
Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

76
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:54,604
It's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

77
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,701
You're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

78
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,013
A little sad about that, sweetie?

79
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,718
I have to tie my shoes, so you
go ahead. I'll catch up.

80
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:18,727
Come on, that's not running!
Let's go!

81
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:26,698
I'm telling you, when she runs...

82
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,033
...she looks like Kermit the Frog...

83
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:31,266
...and the Six Million Dollar Man.

84
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,037
Monica had such a crush on him.

85
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:40,742
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

86
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,146
I used to do that too!

87
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:45,755
Did you also have his album,
"It's Not Easy Being Green"?

88
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:49,492
Oh, Mon.

89
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:53,460
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

90
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,796
Yeah. And I know she'll
want to run again.

91
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,972
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

92
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:03,208
Why don't you be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

93
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,935
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

94
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:12,380
Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't
think I can ever run again, ever!

95
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:17,718
But we were having so much fun.
All those cute guys were checking us out.

96
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,883
I know. They were definitely staring.

97
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:24,489
Why? Why would you do that?

98
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,726
I don't know.

99
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,761
Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.

100
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:32,534
-Ankle.
-We'll see.

101
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,440
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

102
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:41,374
Thanks for helping me, man.

103
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:43,271
Joe?

104
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,153
Well, I guess Joey went home.

105
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:56,789
And look, there is still one box
I have to unpack.

106
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,630
I got you!

107
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:06,466
Oh, my God, you almost gave me
a heart attack.

108
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,775
It was so hard not to laugh.

109
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,702
Hey, the place looks great.

110
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,037
Not bad, right?

111
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:18,148
Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

112
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,047
You know what else I'll do?

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,153
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get her some flowers.

114
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,253
Who wouldn't want to live with me?

115
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:26,817
I don't.

116
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:31,257
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer!

117
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,465
How's that going? Are you okay
with the not-flirting thing?

118
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,532
So far. But it's tough.

119
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:40,932
I've got this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

120
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,336
How you doing?

121
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,246
Get out!

122
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,281
Oh, man!

123
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,055
Sorry. There's just
more room out here.

124
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:05,356
No, you just reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

125
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,262
Why don't you try to be...?

126
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,940
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

127
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,938
I didn't want you to touch me...

128
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:21,271
...because I'm all sweaty
from the workout.

129
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,146
I'm gonna hit the shower.

130
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,911
Oh, my God!

131
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,089
Sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

132
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,157
It's just my thongs are
too delicate for the dryer.

133
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,863
Oh, yeah, it's me.

134
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:51,167
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

135
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,672
You lied so you could run by yourself.

136
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,938
No, Phoebe, no. I was....

137
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,809
I was actually just checking...

138
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,177
...to see...

139
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:01,148
...if I could run. And I can!

140
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:02,752
Please, I'm not an idiot.

141
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,318
No, wait. Phoebe?

142
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:20,005
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

143
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:25,440
I am working right now. So say what you
have to say and leave me alone!

144
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,105
Sound alike too.

145
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:31,214
So, Mondler....

146
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,749
What are you doing?

147
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,150
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.

148
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:42,724
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all her stuff?

149
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:45,564
I don't need that.
I'll put everything back.

150
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,062
Put it back exactly
where you found it?

151
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:51,533
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

152
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,295
First of all,
that attitude is not helping.

153
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,872
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

154
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,604
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

155
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,618
She'll recognize
that I did a nice thing...

156
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:07,546
...and appreciate it.

157
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:10,245
Actually, this will work out well.

158
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,390
Because when you move back
with Joey...

159
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,617
...Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

160
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,753
Oh, I see. You're trying
to freak me out.

161
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:23,594
Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

162
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,534
Believe me, I lived with her for
16 years. She's going to freak out.

163
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,266
Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.

164
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:34,639
That probably won't hurt as much anymore.

165
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,442
No, she is not.
I'll prove it to you.

166
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,412
I'll call her right now.

167
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,118
Phone's done.

168
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,323
-Hey, Mon. How's it going?
-<i>Terrible.</i>

169
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,891
If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

170
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,790
Other people just wreck stuff.

171
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,930
I think I might kill someone tonight.

172
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:00,502
Come on, it can't be that bad.

173
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,400
The only thing getting me through...

174
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,542
...is knowing I'll see you soon.

175
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:07,975
<i>I might even try</i>
<i>to get out of here early.</i>

176
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,044
It sounds like they need you there.

177
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:13,877
-You're just hanging out with Ross?
-It's all good! Okay, bye!

178
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,120
She's gonna kill me.

179
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:20,089
The phone was facing the other way.

180
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,292
And that goes back up there.

181
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:28,823
This is good. This is under control.
We should start with the big stuff.

182
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:32,471
That'll be the easiest.
Let's start with the couch.

183
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:35,097
I got it.

184
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,943
That doesn't look right.

185
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:44,308
What are you talking about?
The couch is in line with the carpet.

186
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,816
Then I can just walk over here
and casually put my feet up on....

187
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:51,783
Okay, here's what we do.

188
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,424
We move the couch
closer to the coffee table.

189
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,652
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the carpet.

190
00:11:57,964 --> 00:12:00,990
Well, we'll just move
the coffee table...

191
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,167
...closer to the couch.

192
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:07,566
But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

193
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,308
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table!

194
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,844
Look, what am I gonna do?

195
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:21,544
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame!

196
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,293
What the hell's going on over here?

197
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:32,362
Monica's gonna kill you!

198
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,159
I need your help.

199
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:39,030
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

200
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,103
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

201
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,171
You guys repel women all the time!

202
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:47,371
Hey, I've been married three times.

203
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:54,545
No, I've seen it happen.

204
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:58,587
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

205
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:02,489
Time after time after time after time.

206
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:03,923
What's your secret?

207
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,692
We do not repel women, okay?

208
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,662
That is completely untrue.

209
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:12,496
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

210
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,470
Remember when we went to a dance...

211
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,801
...and you walked up to that girl
you liked and talked...

212
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,513
...about the Irish potato famine?

213
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:25,384
What about you?
You weren't so hot either.

214
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,915
After everything he said,
he'd go--

215
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,887
Monica doesn't like that either.
I should stop doing that.

216
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:37,753
Girls don't like it when
I start talking about science.

217
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:40,191
That's not specific to girls.

218
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,101
This is great. What else?

219
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,133
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

220
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:49,863
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

221
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:55,111
They don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

222
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:59,884
-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
-I'm never gonna find love again.

223
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,719
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

224
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:16,697
Phoebe, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, okay?

225
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,097
I handled the situation horribly.

226
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,704
And I should not have lied to you.

227
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:24,610
So what should you have done?

228
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:27,104
I should have told you the truth.

229
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:29,581
Which is?

230
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,984
Well, the reason I didn't
want to go running with you is...

231
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,781
...because...

232
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:40,322
...the way that you run
is just a little....

233
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,362
-So?
-It's embarrassing.

234
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,791
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

235
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,866
-Why do you care?
-Because they're people!

236
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:53,131
People you don't know
and will never see again.

237
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,499
Yes, but still they are people...

238
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,037
...with eyes.

239
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:01,945
I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss....

240
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:06,115
But okay.

241
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,551
I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

242
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,417
Okay. You're uptight.

243
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,389
What? I am not uptight.

244
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:21,289
I am not uptight, man.

245
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,502
That's okay. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

246
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:30,205
I'm more free, you know.
I run like I did when I was a kid...

247
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,173
...because that's the only way
it's fun, you know?

248
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:36,847
Didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off...

249
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,952
...like when you were running towards
the swings or running away from Satan?

250
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:46,716
The neighbor's dog.

251
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,198
Is this in the right place?

252
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,662
Who cares? I repel women.

253
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,502
You can't come in here!

254
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,332
Ross is naked!

255
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,213
I couldn't say I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

256
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,782
Why does anyone have to be naked?

257
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:18,146
Why is Ross naked?

258
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:24,392
I had to show Chandler something.

259
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,924
Naked?

260
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:33,171
I guess I have...

261
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,570
...a "guy" problem.

262
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:40,073
Is it the same thing
Chandler had?

263
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:47,576
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later!

264
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:51,883
There's still some of Chandler's
medicine in the bathroom.

265
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,858
-Bye.
-Bye!

266
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,092
Thank God.

267
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,499
Dude, what'd you have?

268
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:12,005
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.

269
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:15,042
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

270
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:16,203
The photo album!

271
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,283
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

272
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,077
We just match everything
to the pictures!

273
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:25,620
That's perfect! That's brilliant!

274
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:29,720
What'd you have?

275
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:35,124
I've got some beer for you.

276
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:39,596
Don't you mean "for whom"?

277
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:42,666
Sure.

278
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:46,576
I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

279
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:50,111
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

280
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:54,647
Is something wrong?

281
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:59,347
Yeah. I'm depressed about that
Irish potato famine.

282
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:04,524
No, I mean with me. Because you seem
to be acting really weird around me.

283
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:07,759
All right, all right.

284
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,933
Let's just get this
out in the open, okay?

285
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:12,966
You're hot.

286
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,763
I'm lovable.

287
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,538
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

288
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:20,905
But we're roommates...

289
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,810
...and it's a huge mistake
for us to continue down this road.

290
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:28,609
Imagine living in a supermarket...

291
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:30,254
...and you'll understand.

292
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,155
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

293
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,987
There isn't anything to do.

294
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,765
I think you're really sweet.

295
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,560
But I'm not interested
in you like that.

296
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,632
No, I mean....

297
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:57,547
You're a nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

298
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,785
I'm just, you know, I just...

299
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:03,146
...don't feel that way about you.

300
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:07,915
I see what happened.

301
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:11,224
It's because I was trying
to repel you.

302
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:16,367
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

303
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,801
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.

304
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,809
How you doing?

305
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:28,279
I'm okay.

306
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,310
What?

307
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:32,473
What?

308
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,317
Oh, dear God!

309
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,602
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great!

310
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:03,747
And you don't care if people stare.
It's only a second. Then you're gone!

311
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,342
It's amazing!
I feel so free and so graceful!

312
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:15,216
Watch out for the horse.

313
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,424
Can I come in now?

314
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,743
-Why is everything different?
-Bye.

315
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,249
I don't see anything different...

316
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:44,149
...other than the fact that the room
got brighter when you came into it.

317
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:47,624
The end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre...

318
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,125
...and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

319
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:53,622
Okay, don't be mad, okay?

320
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:59,027
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted
to do something nice for you...

321
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,239
...so I cleaned the apartment.

322
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:05,935
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot...

323
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:09,476
...where it went back.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.

324
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,811
That's okay.

325
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,612
Are you afraid of me or something?

326
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:18,422
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

327
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,354
Of course not.

328
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:25,124
My gosh, Chandler, what you did
is a wonderful thing...

329
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:27,160
...and I really appreciate it.

330
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,835
I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

331
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:33,570
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

332
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,536
Really?

333
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:37,468
Of course.

334
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, you're the best.

335
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:41,904
You come here to me.

336
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,243
Hold on, okay?
First things first.

337
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,919
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

338
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,657
It said that by the year 2030...

339
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,057
...there'll be computers carrying
out the same number of functions...

340
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,323
...as an actual human brain.

341
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,934
So, theoretically, you could
download your thoughts...

342
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,366
...and your memories
