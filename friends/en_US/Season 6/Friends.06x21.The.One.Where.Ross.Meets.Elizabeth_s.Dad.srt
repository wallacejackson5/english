1
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:03,881
-Okay, Chandler.
-Okay.

2
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:05,881
And your horoscope says:

3
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:09,544
"On the 5th, a special
someone will give you a gift."

4
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:11,690
Well, thank you in advance.

5
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:15,088
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."

6
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,820
You're going to make fun
of my present.

7
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:20,459
Why would you do that?

8
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:26,067
Wait. "On the 19th,
a secret crush announces itself."

9
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,038
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

10
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:36,545
It's Joey Tribbiani
of <i>Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.</i>

11
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:40,447
That's right. It's your first day.

12
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:43,885
Are you psyched to fight crime
with your robot sidekick?

13
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,719
Am I?
The lead in my own TV series?

14
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,521
I've dreamed about this for years!

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,755
Why have I not been preparing?

16
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,964
You're gonna be great.

17
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:59,068
But I gotta act with a robot.
I know nothing about technology.

18
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:02,139
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.

19
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:07,240
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.

20
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:11,316
Our spat will start early this month.

21
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,849
I'll be waiting.

22
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,617
The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad

23
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:59,098
Are you judging them by their covers?
You're really not supposed to.

24
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:03,493
I'm deciding which one to use. I'm
going to write another book.

25
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:07,633
Because the last one
was such a big seller?

26
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,108
If you must know,
I have written 14 books.

27
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:14,111
And as I'm the only one
who has read them...

28
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:17,772
...I can tell you that
they have been well received.

29
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:21,884
But I lost all of them in the fire.

30
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:26,754
So this one I'm gonna keep in an
asbestos-lined box far away from Rachel.

31
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,160
Who I forgive.

32
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,832
What are you doing later?

33
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,299
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.

34
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:39,663
-We do?
-I wanna see what he wants.

35
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:44,535
Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.

36
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,836
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.

37
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:49,140
You're not Elizabeth's dad?

38
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:55,081
That's the only one you get.

39
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:56,981
And he hates me.

40
00:02:57,157 --> 00:03:00,024
He asked Elizabeth why she'd want
to go out with a guy...

41
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:02,184
...who couldn't get a girl his own age.

42
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,620
And what did she say to that?

43
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,930
And that's yours.

44
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,967
Come on. I really want
this guy to like me.

45
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:16,199
It would really help if you guys
could make me look good.

46
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,434
-Of course we'll help.
-Thanks.

47
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:23,176
We know how tough those
parent-teacher conferences can be.

48
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,485
-So here's your office set.
-Wow!

49
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:35,961
Mac Machiavelli, private investigator.

50
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,158
Look at all the books I've read.

51
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,561
Let's get you to wardrobe.

52
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:46,833
When do I meet the robot?

53
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,768
Right now. He's right here.

54
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:51,774
Joey Tribbiani, this is--

55
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:54,913
Wow! He's so lifelike.

56
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,307
Unbelievable.

57
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:00,953
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.

58
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,882
How do you do there, buddy?

59
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:06,114
I'll let you two guys get acquainted.

60
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,624
Sorry about that.

61
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:11,991
-So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.

62
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,769
Nice to meet you, Mac.

63
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:26,939
-This is the temporary robot, right?
-No. Why?

64
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,678
I thought it was gonna be
a really cool robot.

65
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:34,149
Like the Terminator,
or when I first saw you.

66
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:38,848
I spent two years developing this.
It's state of the art.

67
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:42,051
Sorry. It doesn't look like
it can do anything.

68
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:43,722
It can do this.

69
00:04:56,242 --> 00:05:00,110
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.

70
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,381
It's great to meet you, Paul.

71
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:06,180
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends
address me as Mr. Stevens.

72
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,883
Of course. Mr. Stevens.

73
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:11,683
So, Ross...

74
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,716
...what's your problem?

75
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,822
Excuse me?

76
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,223
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?

77
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,665
It's funny....

78
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:25,935
It's not funny.

79
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:29,200
I don't like you going out
with my daughter, Ross.

80
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,344
Okay, I can see that.

81
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:37,116
I think if you give me one chance,
I can change your mind.

82
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,714
-Okay.
-What?

83
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,249
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.

84
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:46,651
You've got one minute.

85
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,360
-Daddy.
-Fine. Two minutes. Go.

86
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,827
A minute and 50 seconds.

87
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:03,169
I want you to know, I've
never done anything like this before.

88
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,537
I mean, I've been in relationships
in general.

89
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:09,909
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not....

90
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:14,514
Not "it." We haven't done "it."

91
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:18,248
I mean, we've done stuff....

92
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:24,591
Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.

93
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:27,366
Two guys go into a bar.
One of them is Irish.

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,696
-I'm Irish.
-And the Irish guy wins the joke.

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,409
Ross! How crazy
that we would run into you.

96
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,606
Oh, my God! Thank you.

97
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:44,679
I'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica and Chandler.

98
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:46,276
-Phoebe.
-Hello.

99
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:47,681
-Monica.
-Hi.

100
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,378
Chunder.

101
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,547
-Chandler.
-Never going to remember that.

102
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:57,224
You're Elizabeth's dad?
I see where she gets her...

103
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,159
...rugged handsomeness.

104
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,330
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?

105
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,529
There's a Mr. Bing!

106
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:13,540
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed
away after she was born.

107
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,439
I raised her by myself.

108
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:18,816
I get that a lot.

109
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,448
Why don't we all take a seat?

110
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:27,023
I'll get us all some coffees.

111
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:28,851
Yeah, why don't you....

112
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,663
Talk about
whatever you want.

113
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,699
Whatever pops into your head.

114
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,334
It is strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,270
...because usually
he's at the children's hospital.

116
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,507
But not looking for dates.

117
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,908
Monica is Ross's sister.

118
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,844
He's a great brother!

119
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,919
I had a sister.

120
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,657
She passed away.

121
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,426
You don't have to do that every time.

122
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:05,855
But Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.

123
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,396
Funny story....

124
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:11,735
Your roommate in college died,
didn't he?

125
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:16,198
A part of him did, yes.

126
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,605
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.

127
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:21,440
I hope you guys are finding
something to talk about.

128
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:23,582
-Yes. We were just--
-Sorry I'm late.

129
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,947
But I am ready to talk you up.

130
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:30,385
-When does Liz's father get here?
-I'm already here.

131
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:33,793
Ross is so great!

132
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,697
Hey, Pheebs.
How's the book writing going?

133
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,392
Really well. I'm up to page 47.

134
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:45,662
-Wow! What are you writing?
-Page numbers.

135
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,331
Honey, you got the kind
with the little girl.

136
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,673
You said you'd buy the kind
with the baby.

137
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:54,938
-You said the baby creeps you out.
-The little girl does.

138
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:57,680
-You said the baby.
-Why would a baby creep me out?

139
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,614
Why would the little girl
creep you out?

140
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,119
Can you please talk a little slower?

141
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,655
-This is for your book?
-It's about relationships.

142
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:08,384
The traps, the pitfalls,
what not to do.

143
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,755
Keep going. This stuff's great.

144
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:13,124
Excuse me.

145
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:17,770
And how none of it matters when
the people really love each other.

146
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:23,342
And how people will believe anything
as long as it's a compliment.

147
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:31,409
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

148
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:36,478
-I left my keys here somewhere.
-Well, let's look for them.

149
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,489
Hey, look! Are these them?

150
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,591
No.

151
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,559
All right.

152
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,224
-Here they are.
-Good.

153
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:51,300
-Thanks for your help.
-Wait! Sorry!

154
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,404
-Mr. Paul?
-Just call me Paul.

155
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,575
Paul.
I just wanted you to know that...

156
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,971
...Ross really is a great guy.

157
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:03,373
Maybe you could date him. It'd
save me the trouble of killing him.

158
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:08,843
Are you okay?

159
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,053
You don't look old enough
to have a 20-year-old daughter.

160
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:14,658
Well, we were very young
when we had her.

161
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:18,319
-We?
-It usually takes two people to....

162
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,431
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!

163
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:26,435
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?

164
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:27,900
I'm just me.

165
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,370
My wife died shortly after
Lizzie was born.

166
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,940
So you raised her all on your own?

167
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,442
Yes, I did.

168
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,748
-What are you writing there?
-I'm drawing a picture of you.

169
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,116
Well, that's very flattering.

170
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:51,889
But it'd be great if you could draw me
with some clothes and a head.

171
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:56,962
How was your first day?

172
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,695
Pretty good. Except I got
attitude from the robot.

173
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:03,565
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!

174
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:07,144
It was the guy who controls the robot.

175
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,805
He hates me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
knock over the sandwich table...

176
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,110
...right when I was reaching for one.

177
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,980
Why don't you get him fired?

178
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:18,715
I may have to. I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?

179
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:23,688
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.

180
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,788
Excuse me.

181
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,096
Joey Tribbiani.

182
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:32,829
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.

183
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:36,101
<i>But it's kind of on the q.t.</i>

184
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,006
The actor who has the part
doesn't know he might be fired.

185
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,238
<i>It's the lead in a series.</i>

186
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:43,972
<i>Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.</i>

187
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,644
I'm the lead in <i>Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.</i>

188
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,726
Joey?

189
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,587
Hi, Ross.

190
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,229
I was just getting him to like you.

191
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:08,466
Joey!

192
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:13,806
Ross, Joey is not here.

193
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,105
I'll just wait for him in here!

194
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,009
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.

195
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,112
Yeah. It's okay. It's me...

196
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:23,717
...Mr. Stevens.

197
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:28,588
I didn't.... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.

198
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:32,388
You did. You came in, got all awkward
and ran to the bedroom.

199
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,293
You were shouting, "Joey!"

200
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,368
-Bye, Rachel.
-Bye.

201
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,538
I'll call you later.

202
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,329
-See you.
-Bye, Ross.

203
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:48,004
What? What the--? How did...? What?

204
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:53,685
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.

205
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,376
In your mouth?

206
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:58,890
No!

207
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,117
Downstairs. And we got to talking...

208
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:05,263
...for two hours. I liked him.
I invited him for coffee.

209
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:08,327
You were at the coffeehouse!

210
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,568
What's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy.

211
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:16,332
He is my girlfriend's father.
It's weird!

212
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:20,009
-You dated my sister!
-That was different!

213
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:24,176
-What? Why?
-This is weird for me!

214
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:28,148
Ross, look. This is good for you.

215
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,713
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving you.

216
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:35,383
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.

217
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:39,929
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.

218
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:43,735
Plus the guy
is a very successful lawyer.

219
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:47,972
-How is that important?
-It's important!

220
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:52,506
There's a million guys
who can play Mac...

221
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:53,974
...and there's one robot.

222
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,843
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.

223
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,077
-What am I gonna do?
-You're a pretty charming guy.

224
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,881
Thanks. But I have a problem
to deal with.

225
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:08,523
No, you've got to win over
the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.

226
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:12,527
Go back there
and kiss some serious robot ass!

227
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,091
That's not a bad idea!

228
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:20,498
If I have to be charming tomorrow,
I'm not wasting it on you guys.

229
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:23,073
I got some saved for you, Pheebs.

230
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,679
Do you think Joey is
more charming than me?

231
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,413
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
with him on the side.

232
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,412
You wish.

233
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,881
"You wish."

234
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,487
Stop writing about us.

235
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:44,992
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.

236
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,232
-Who?
-Marsha and Chester.

237
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:54,395
Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.

238
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:59,008
-"Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
-I see what you're doing.

239
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:01,846
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing."

240
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:07,318
I have tasted my own medicine
and it is bitter!

241
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:14,586
Morning!

242
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,685
How's my favorite genius
and his robot?

243
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,023
-Don't touch him!
-Okay.

244
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:26,266
Level with me. I keep hearing
rumors that I might get fired.

245
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:29,598
They even have actors reading
for my part.

246
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,533
Come on. You gotta give me
a second chance.

247
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,406
I love this little guy.

248
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:39,410
That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right?

249
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,382
I can't believe it. God!

250
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,251
Hey, how are you doing?

251
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:57,500
So it seemed that my prom date
had stood me up.

252
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,307
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

253
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,670
What a nice story.

254
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:06,504
So Ross was in college...

255
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,343
...and decided to jump at the chance
to take a young girl to her prom.

256
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:16,680
I definitely did not see
that one backfiring.

257
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,614
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Take your time.

258
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:27,162
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
So it wasn't as bad as--

259
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,366
Look. I know I've been giving you
a lot of jabs.

260
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:34,769
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...

261
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:40,437
...and partly because
they just keep coming to me.

262
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:45,550
I admit after all the
wonderful things Lizzie told me...

263
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:50,984
...and the many, many, many stories
that Rachel has told me...

264
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:53,017
...well...

265
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,154
...you're not...

266
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,122
...all bad.

267
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,860
"Not all bad."

268
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:06,033
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.

269
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:10,164
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a 12-year-old girl.

270
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:14,373
I know what you mean. I do that too.

271
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:20,512
-I beg your pardon?
-I don't see her as a 12-year-old.

272
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:25,246
I mean, I have a son who is 6
and I still think of him as a baby.

273
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:30,225
-A son?
-My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.

274
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,763
Incidentally, Carol and I
are on excellent terms...

275
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,161
...as I'm sure you are with your wife.

276
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,426
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:40,405
It's unbelievable!

278
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,936
Don't worry. I didn't realize
you were married.

279
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:47,844
We were. But that was just a....

280
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:54,041
That was just a big drunken mistake.

281
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:57,917
You're back.

282
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,784
You two were married?

283
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:06,222
I'm sorry.
You were talking about Emily.

284
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:11,765
We said we would meet
at the coffeehouse at 6:00.

285
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:12,995
We said 7:00.

286
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,737
We said 6:00!

287
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:16,804
The only way that I said 6:00...

288
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:21,776
...would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

289
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:25,211
If I had said 7:00, I would have said:

290
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:29,047
"My boyfriend is such a
wiseass. 7:00!"

291
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:32,248
-Hi!
-Oh, my good God!

292
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,118
-I know what time you said.
-What?

293
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:38,995
Well, I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.

294
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,933
What time?

295
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:43,158
Interesting turn of events.

296
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:46,838
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
Let's see.

297
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:49,438
Very interesting.

298
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:52,603
Well this certainly clears things up.

299
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,437
What does it say?

300
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,907
I will tell you as soon as you thank
me for writing my book.

301
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:02,853
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...

302
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,684
...and you are the
queen of everything.

303
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,990
Thanks. So are you.

304
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,330
I told you I should
not wear this color.

305
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:26,602
"Monica-- Marsha and Chester are
planning on seeing a movie Sunday.

306
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:31,782
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at
6:00. Chester thinks it's 7:00."

307
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:35,544
-You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
-Right.

308
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:40,448
Instead of telling us, you decided
to write it in your stupid book?

309
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:43,151
"Marsha and Chester
are mad at Phyllis."

310
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:51,027
I can't believe
I'm gonna lose this job.

311
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,838
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?

312
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:58,503
Help me get this mini-fridge
past the security guard.

313
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,408
Joey, I want to talk to you.

314
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:08,085
I don't want to talk to you.

315
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,882
I hate you. You ruined my life.

316
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:14,082
-Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
-Hi.

317
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,320
I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.

318
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:19,626
Why should I help you out?

319
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:23,962
-The reason he just said.
-What do you need?

320
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,497
I saw you on stage talking
to that beautiful woman.

321
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:32,074
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.

322
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:34,469
-Are you in love with her?
-Yeah.

323
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,574
Her. All of them. Anyone.

324
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,746
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.

325
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:43,614
Listen, I guarantee you
keep your job...

326
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,917
...if you can teach me to talk
to women like you do.

327
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:52,055
You can't teach it.
It's something you're born with.

328
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:55,529
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.

329
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,896
-Really?
-Sure. Yeah. I taught him.

330
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,767
Yeah. You should see the woman I'm with,
way out of my league.

331
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:04,205
In fact, if you want, I can get you her.

332
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,071
Well, if you think about it...

333
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:13,309
...Ross did learn something
from each marriage.

334
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,817
How to make the next one even shorter?

335
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:17,682
Wait a minute. That's not fair.

336
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,984
He was married to me a hell of a lot
longer than he was to Emily.

337
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:24,060
He just didn't tell me.

338
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,063
Maybe I have to pee again.

339
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:35,539
Well, this is fun.

340
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,906
So, Ross, did you kill any
of these wives?

341
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:46,842
I have had enough of this! I
care a great deal about your daughter.

342
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,452
And I have treated her with respect!

343
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,885
So if you've got a problem with me--

344
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:54,989
-Are you yelling at me?
-God, no.

345
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:59,995
You know what?
If you don't like Ross, that's fine.

346
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:03,560
It doesn't matter.
I'm going out with him anyway.

347
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,736
Really?

348
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:08,304
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

349
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:12,433
...it doesn't matter to me.
Still not yelling.

350
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,544
What can I say?

351
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,848
I still don't like you.

352
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:25,785
I'm not so crazy
about myself right now either.

353
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,153
-Then we agree?
-I guess so.

354
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,461
-Neither of us like Ross.
-I like Ross.

355
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,962
Kids!

356
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:38,599
I just thought of a story
about how nice Ross is.

357
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,370
That's okay.
We're not liking Ross right now.

358
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,207
Well, I got a lot of those too.

359
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,271
You were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.

360
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:54,176
-The shipment never made it to Omaha?
-You got it.

361
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:57,651
And the rabbi's beard?
100 percent horsehair.

362
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:01,121
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.

363
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,288
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.

364
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,861
Wayne! Wayne!
