1
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:09,080
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.

2
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:12,088
All right.

3
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:16,318
Damn fridge!

4
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:20,392
-Hi, Joey. How you doing?
-Great...

5
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,635
...roomie.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,536
-I guess we are roommates.
-I know.

7
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:29,071
Now that you bring it up,
our fridge is broken.

8
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:30,607
We need a new one.

9
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:34,372
I checked and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

10
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,817
I'm not paying for that.

11
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:40,543
I'm just here while they fix my place.

12
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:45,384
Look, Rach, my parents bought this
fridge just after I was born. Okay?

13
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:50,119
I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

14
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:54,224
What does that tell you?

15
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:58,026
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

16
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:03,707
You know the ATM
only lets you take out 300, so...

17
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,744
...I'll take a check for the rest.

18
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:08,437
You're joking, right?

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,985
Of course I'm joking.
I don't take checks.

20
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:16,985
Thank God, you're pretty.

21
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,620
The One With Joey's Fridge

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,633
Hi! Do you guys know any cute guys?

23
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:05,805
Of course.
My good friend Joey over here.

24
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,372
I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

25
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:17,679
There's a charity ball
and Ralph Lauren has a table...

26
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:19,010
...so I have to go.

27
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,346
-What charity?
-I don't know.

28
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:25,047
Something, either trees or disease....

29
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,317
Ralph mumbles a lot.

30
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:32,389
-He mumbles when you're not attentive?
-Yeah. It's weird.

31
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,563
But I need to find a date.

32
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,292
What kind of date?

33
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:41,371
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

34
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:44,442
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

35
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,573
So close.

36
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,978
-Hey, everybody!
-Hi, there.

37
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,843
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi, Elizabeth.

38
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:54,915
I'm the student.

39
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,684
Isn't she cute? Nope.

40
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,618
Weren't you guys supposed to...

41
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:04,888
...not be seen together?

42
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:06,154
We aren't.

43
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:10,426
We just happen
to have run into each other here.

44
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,137
This is....

45
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:16,075
Oh, sly!

46
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:19,537
I wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

47
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:21,179
-See you later?
-Okay.

48
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,144
-Bye, Ross.
-Bye. See you.

49
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:27,485
-Didn't mean to run into you, sir.
-That's quite all right, ma'am.

50
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,086
Bye.

51
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:33,424
Why is she leaving? Is it a
school night and she has homework?

52
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:37,988
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

53
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,860
Tell her good luck with that.

54
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,760
Anyone else? Bring them on.

55
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,665
-When's her birthday?
-I don't know. Why?

56
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:52,071
It's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

57
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,940
-I like Elizabeth.
-Well, thanks.

58
00:03:56,149 --> 00:04:00,643
I like her so much, tell her
I want my cookies early this year.

59
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:04,421
A box of Thin Mints
and some Tagalongs.

60
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,219
Give him a break.
Ross, how's it going with her?

61
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:09,793
It's been great.

62
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:15,033
She's 20, so she's not too serious,
which is perfect for me now.

63
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:18,236
That's great.
Seriously, she seems nice.

64
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:21,372
I know you guys like
to give me a hard time...

65
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,133
...but it means a lot to me.

66
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,176
-Just knowing--
-Okay, I got a good one.

67
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,041
What is she, like, 12?

68
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,124
Chandler, do we talk about
our relationship enough?

69
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:47,065
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?

70
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,496
Okay.

71
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,570
I thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take to her thing.

72
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:55,741
That's so funny.
We found someone too.

73
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,877
Good. She'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

74
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:04,348
-Why would our guy be a weirdo?
-Because that's just your taste.

75
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,645
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

76
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,879
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

77
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:13,082
My guy is a lawyer,
who does volunteer work.

78
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,693
And he has one of these.

79
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,331
A face ass?

80
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,995
A chin dimple.

81
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,425
Well, you know, our guy works
with Chandler.

82
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,696
He's really nice and smart,
and he's a great dresser.

83
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:31,203
-Have you seen your guy's body?
-No. Our guy's just a floating head.

84
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,045
Well, my guy is spectacular.
He's a massage client.

85
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:40,982
And one time, when he was on the
table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.

86
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:45,516
-You're not supposed to look.
-Like there are police for that.

87
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,923
You look? You massaged me.

88
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:50,926
I know.

89
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:56,968
Fine. Your guy may have a great body,
but our guy is really funny.

90
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,229
Chandler funny?

91
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:02,137
-Our guy's a great dancer.
-My guy's well-read.

92
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,572
-Our guy has great hair.
-My guy has great teeth.

93
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:07,142
Our guy smells incredible.

94
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,416
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

95
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,822
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

96
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:27,258
The fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

97
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,699
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

98
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,833
What was in that brown jar?

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,339
-That's still in there?
-Not anymore.

100
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:40,440
So anyway, how do you want to pay me?

101
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:45,647
Is this a service you're providing me?

102
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,887
No, for my new fridge.
For our new fridge.

103
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,623
Our new fridge?

104
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,191
-I don't live here anymore.
-So what?

105
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,795
Look, okay, suppose we were
a divorced couple.

106
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,789
And I got custody of the kid. Right?

107
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:04,970
Now suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

108
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:09,741
Okay.

109
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,868
Give me $400!

110
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,707
Thank God, you're pretty.

111
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,191
Professor Geller?

112
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,784
Oh, a student I don't know.

113
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:33,924
I was wondering if I
could talk to you for a moment?

114
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,635
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

115
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,361
Making out in your office.

116
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,135
Of course. Why don't we go inside.

117
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:54,244
-What?
-Doorknob.

118
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:55,887
Sorry.

119
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,784
I actually do need to talk to you.

120
00:07:58,992 --> 00:07:59,981
What about?

121
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,557
-Spring vacation?
-Spring vacation?

122
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:06,127
Yeah, we have time off, and
a lot of people are going on trips--

123
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:10,402
-Professor Geller.
-Yes, Professor Friesenstinlender.

124
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,666
I'll be with you in one moment.

125
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:17,741
So I will take one box
of the Thin Mints.

126
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:27,085
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

127
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,949
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this.

128
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,387
-What do I tell her?
-Tell her the truth, tell her you're not ready.

129
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,228
I could do that.

130
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,163
-What if she gets upset?
-Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

131
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,631
Or you could just, you know, you....

132
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,273
What the hell are you doing?

133
00:08:56,349 --> 00:09:00,786
What the hell am I doing?
You just broke my fridge!

134
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:02,947
What? How do--?

135
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,124
How do you know it's even broken?

136
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:08,855
You think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

137
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,122
Excuse me!

138
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:13,861
Well, what do you know?

139
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,328
Broken!

140
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,101
That'll be $400.

141
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,239
Joey, I saw you push him.

142
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:25,242
You pushed him.

143
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,174
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

144
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:37,719
Remember I told you about our fridge?

145
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:41,360
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

146
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:43,620
Do not give him any money!

147
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,664
I'm not talking to you!
You broke my fridge!

148
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,709
-You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
-Yes. Please come in.

149
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,586
-Doorknob?
-Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

150
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:12,187
I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

151
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,757
Good.

152
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,386
Look, I....

153
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:24,593
Look, I'm having
a great time with you.

154
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:30,139
And I just don't want us to move too
fast or put too much pressure on us.

155
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,602
So I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

156
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,212
It's too soon.

157
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:38,876
Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

158
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:45,186
I just wanted to tell you that I'm
going to Florida for a couple weeks.

159
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,920
No.

160
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,826
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

161
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:55,961
What I meant was--

162
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,499
You are so adorable.

163
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:00,673
That. Let's talk about that.

164
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,474
-Hi.
-Hi.

165
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,305
How did it go with Elizabeth?

166
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,879
Fine. Just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

167
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,680
She just wanted to let me know
she's going to Florida for a spring vacation.

168
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:19,153
Wait a minute. Is she going
for spring vacation or spring break? Wahoo!

169
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,121
What's the difference?

170
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:26,557
Spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

171
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,427
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

172
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,230
You know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

173
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,466
-What did you do on yours?
-I went to Egypt with my dad.

174
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:43,973
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo!"

175
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:49,584
I think Elizabeth is a little more
serious than: "Spring break, wahoo!"

176
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,316
Come on, she's taking my class.

177
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,790
-And slept with the professor.
-I'm gonna call her.

178
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,391
You guys,
I want you to meet Sebastian.

179
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:08,702
We met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last <i>Field and Stream.</i>

180
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,373
What? I read that.

181
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:16,040
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-Yes. Thank you.

182
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:21,881
-Rachel, what the hell is this?
-What?

183
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:25,989
You ask us to find a guy, and you come
traipsing in here with a guy of your own?

184
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,281
You found me a guy?

185
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:31,122
Yes. We found you a really cute,
funny guy from Chandler's work.

186
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,766
Yeah, and I found you one too,
who is not a weirdo.

187
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:39,762
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

188
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,735
...but I'm gonna take Sebastian.

189
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,842
Are you sure?
Our guy smells incredible.

190
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,478
Would you stop it with that already?

191
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,574
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

192
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:54,780
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

193
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,279
-Not really. Why?
-No reason.

194
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,755
I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

195
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,357
Are you funny?

196
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,130
-Excuse me?
-What are you guys doing?

197
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,694
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

198
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:13,535
I just wanted to have coffee
with Rachel.

199
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,003
Well, so do a lot of people.

200
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:19,934
-Actually, I gotta get going.
-But you--

201
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:23,538
-Give me a call sometime.
-You didn't give me your phone number.

202
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,410
Okay, see you later.

203
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:29,945
Turns out he is kind of funny.

204
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:33,115
I cannot believe you guys!

205
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,352
He was really nice,
and he just left because of you!

206
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:39,594
Yeah, but "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

207
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,629
You know what I noticed, Rachel?
He scares easy.

208
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,169
Is that the kind of guy you wanna take
to a ball?

209
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,341
"Hey, Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

210
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:51,332
"Okay. I gotta go."

211
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,211
Stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

212
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:58,076
That is a very
insensitive thing to do.

213
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:01,582
Let us make it up to you.
We have two really great guys for you.

214
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:03,487
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

215
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:08,626
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

216
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,689
-All right.
-So you will meet our guys?

217
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:12,922
Yes.

218
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,992
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

219
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:18,203
Our guy is perfect.

220
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:23,541
Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe
deemed not good enough for herself.

221
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,541
There you are!
You broke my fridge.

222
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:28,213
You owe me $400.

223
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,683
-Okay, sure.
-Really?

224
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:37,088
Technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

225
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,259
...on your last 10 auditions.

226
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:45,294
Call it even?

227
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:48,726
Okay.

228
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,131
There you are.

229
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,871
What did Elizabeth say?

230
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:58,571
Turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, wahoo."

231
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:03,477
That means wet T-shirt contests, guys
doing shots off of girls' bodies...

232
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:04,775
...waking up with strangers.

233
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:07,316
She is gonna have a great time!

234
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,687
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

235
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:16,259
-You know the hotels?
-I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo!

236
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,158
In 1981, you were 13.

237
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,667
So? I drove down, sold T-shirts.
Had a blast.

238
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:26,770
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

239
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,899
Okay, she can't go.

240
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:34,341
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

241
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,572
-What am I supposed to do?
-You just have to be cool with it.

242
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:40,650
What if she goes down there and sleeps
with a bunch of guys?

243
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,578
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

244
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:51,096
I'm sorry, this is very serious.
And you know what, Ross?

245
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:55,098
You like her, she likes you,
everything's gonna be fine.

246
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:57,701
You're right.
I'm probably overreacting.

247
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,566
It's just she's staying at this party hotel
on the beach...

248
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,174
...with a huge pool and free drinks
with every meal.

249
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:07,904
If she's got enough money for that, she
can certainly pat for the fridge she broke.

250
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,978
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

251
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:20,090
I've been working
so hard this semester.

252
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,784
I really need to go crazy,
blow off some steam.

253
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,792
Sure.

254
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:30,325
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet, but...

255
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:33,769
...I know a great way
to blow off steam.

256
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:36,840
-What?
-Are you into crafts at all?

257
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:40,006
Ross, are you okay?

258
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,310
Yeah. Of course I'm okay.

259
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm just being supportive.

260
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,617
Supportive of you
and this whole trip...

261
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,687
...and what's this?

262
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,157
It's a bathing suit?

263
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:56,493
To wear in front of people?

264
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,059
Is that supportive?

265
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:01,529
Is this?

266
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,663
Okay, good.

267
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,837
-Hey.
-Hi.

268
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:10,008
We're so glad you decided to
meet our guy. You'll like him so much.

269
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:13,074
-When do you want to meet him?
-I don't know.

270
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,146
-I don't work late tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow night is good.

271
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,945
But why put off something till
tomorrow that you could do it right now?

272
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:23,451
-Eldad, come here!
-What?

273
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,321
-This is Rachel.
-How are you?

274
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,959
A little blindsided but good.

275
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,891
Eldad, sit down. Move over now.

276
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,892
There you go. There you are.

277
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,700
Okay, we can take a hint!

278
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,803
What? What are you doing here?

279
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,202
This is Patrick.

280
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,366
-Hi.
-Hi.

281
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:48,138
You're too late because
she's already with our guy.

282
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:52,716
You're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

283
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,013
Come on.

284
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:58,256
Rachel? This is Patrick.

285
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,382
-Hi.
-Hi.

286
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,356
This is the guy I was telling you about.

287
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:06,497
This suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

288
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,794
Okay.

289
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:13,104
But, Pheebs, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

290
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,864
Okay. That's okay. Have a seat.

291
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:19,001
-You can't do that!
-I should go.

292
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:21,236
Sit down, we're winning.

293
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:24,039
Maybe I should go.

294
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,184
No. Have a seat!

295
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:29,081
Rachel, you haven't touched
Eldad's hair.

296
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:32,355
-He has the softest hair. Touch it.
-I'm good.

297
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,995
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

298
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,198
This isn't really worth the free massage.

299
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:43,425
-That's right. Bye-bye.
-No.

300
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,729
Eldad is much more cooperative,
and he can dance.

301
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,530
You dance for Rachel.

302
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,972
Don't dance for me. Please!

303
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,578
What is the matter with you?

304
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:55,847
Yeah, let's talk it out.

305
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:59,444
Am I the only one that this is
embarrassing for?

306
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,483
I'm a little embarrassed.

307
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:07,788
I'll tell you who should
be embarrassed. It's you guys.

308
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:10,393
I do not need you
to get me a date.

309
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:13,360
-Why did she ask us to--?
-I am still talking!

310
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,363
Then you chase away
the one guy I actually liked.

311
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:20,129
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

312
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,374
...all the cash.

313
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,735
And you really do have very soft hair.

314
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:31,042
But I'd much rather go to the ball by
myself than go through any more of this.

315
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,478
Goodbye.

316
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,381
Now, do you use some sort of
special conditioner on that hair?

317
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:39,819
Papaya extract.

318
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,253
Thank you.

319
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:49,396
So have a great time down there.

320
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:50,569
-I will.
-Yeah.

321
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,604
-Did you pack that bathing suit?
-Yeah.

322
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:57,435
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while.

323
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:01,870
Anyway.

324
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,245
I am worried about that suit.

325
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:08,420
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

326
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:10,816
I'm concerned about your health.

327
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,589
Sun exposure.

328
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:16,090
Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.

329
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,024
-It's SPF 30.
-All right.

330
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,256
Well, if what's in the bottle
is actually 30.

331
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,867
Sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4 and...

332
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,300
...more often than not, it's just milk.

333
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,874
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

334
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:34,505
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

335
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:35,873
I really like you.

336
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,510
I like how things are going between us.

337
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:39,945
-Really?
-Yeah.

338
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:43,986
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

339
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,123
Okay. Cool.

340
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,019
Here they are!

341
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,136
Call me!

342
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:09,614
Sorry for pushing those guys on you.

343
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:12,715
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

344
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:17,116
The charity was a big success, and they
raised a lot of money and awareness.

345
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:20,156
So, what was it for anyway?

346
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,917
I wanna say a disease.

347
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:30,763
I just got this really weird message
from Ross. He said to turn on MTV.

348
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,409
Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!

349
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,517
Professor Geller.

350
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,593
To be 13 again....
