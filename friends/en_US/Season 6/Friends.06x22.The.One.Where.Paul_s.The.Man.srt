1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,844
Hi, you guys.

2
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:06,575
What's the matter?

3
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:09,779
Well, it's just-- It's one of these
situations that I just hate.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,458
A massage client gave me three tickets...

5
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:15,321
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

6
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:18,187
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

7
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:22,959
No. No. It's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.

8
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:25,397
-I'll give up my ticket.
-Me too.

9
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:27,738
Okay. That's so generous.

10
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:30,171
And I think Ross is generous too.

11
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:33,346
Great! Then it's just us girls.

12
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:34,980
-Great.
-Yeah.

13
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,774
So what is the exhibit?

14
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:40,612
It's mostly just photographs...

15
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:45,781
...of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

16
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:50,724
Oh, man!

17
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:56,698
-Hi.
-Hi.

18
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:57,995
Hey, Ross, listen.

19
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:02,335
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

20
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:08,840
Thanks, but I have plans.
Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

21
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:10,380
-That's great!
-Yeah.

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,814
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.

23
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,008
Why? What?

24
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:17,122
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

25
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,458
That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

26
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,652
You know, let it go. Stop it!

27
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,756
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father...

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,901
...so he's much older than she is.

29
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:34,399
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils.

30
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:39,810
All that does is remind us
that you're interested in fossils.

31
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:42,776
Okay, okay.

32
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:47,977
Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear.

33
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,693
-Ross?
-Come on! That's funny.

34
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:57,591
Because he's gonna--
He's got, like, a hearing aid.

35
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,292
Because he's all old.

36
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,733
One second.

37
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:13,238
Okay, look, Ross.

38
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:17,039
Just so you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

39
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:19,617
...I've accepted the fact
that you're dating her.

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,447
Really? That's great.

41
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,879
Yeah, but then I changed my mind.

42
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,790
I'm funny like that.

43
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,326
So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you.

44
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:32,031
I don't want you
seeing my daughter anymore.

45
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:34,530
Look, I realize it upsets you.

46
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,463
Yes, it does.

47
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:41,098
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

48
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:45,142
...so I don't think there's
anything you can do about it.

49
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:48,179
I'll tell the university about
your relationship and have you fired.

50
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,610
Oh, a man with a plan!

51
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,781
The One Where Paul's The Man

52
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:35,160
This is so exciting. You can get your picture
back up on the wall of fame.

53
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:37,193
He's got all the big actors.

54
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,729
It was so cool when I was up there.

55
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,336
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

56
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:47,036
I get fired off <i>Days of Our Lives</i>
and he takes me down.

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,708
Now he's just laughing at me.

58
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,778
Look at him.
That smug Belushi bastard!

59
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:58,274
Okay. Maybe when they put
your picture back up...

60
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,316
...they could put you by Matt Lauer.

61
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,886
Look at him just smiling at me.

62
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:07,758
Yeah, I know.
We'd be great together.

63
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:14,498
-So I'm back.
-Who are you?

64
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,934
Joey Tribbiani.

65
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:19,802
From the wall?

66
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:23,442
Okay, maybe this
will jog your memory.

67
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:28,503
Okay, anyway.

68
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:32,446
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.

69
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:36,918
-Show me in the TV book.
-It's not on TV yet.

70
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:39,921
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

71
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:44,421
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.

72
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:48,567
So, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes?

73
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,067
Maybe? Just ones that
haven't been cleaned yet?

74
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,536
God.

75
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,676
I love museums.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,110
-Soaking up all the culture.
-Yeah.

77
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:06,046
-Where do you want to start?
-The gift shop!

78
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,080
-And then lunch.
-Yes, but I can't eat too much.

79
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,590
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

80
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:18,057
Do you think maybe
he's gonna tell you he's gay?

81
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,697
What? No, why?

82
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,563
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

83
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:28,839
You could put the aisle over here
and have the wedding ceremony over here.

84
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,010
I didn't know you could get married here.

85
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,509
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

86
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,275
But I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I would never have the ceremony there.

87
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,577
You'd have the ceremony
under a beautiful arch.

88
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,680
May I help you?

89
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:45,148
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's just such a beautiful space.

90
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:47,793
-Do you do a lot of weddings?
-Yes, we're popular.

91
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,724
There's a two-year waiting list.
Sorry.

92
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,223
Monica, you should put
your name down for this place.

93
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,196
What? Are you crazy?

94
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,333
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.

95
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:02,834
But there's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

96
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,234
Then you've got to wait
another two years?

97
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:08,209
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

98
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,383
He's gonna find somebody else.

99
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,983
Someone who did put their name
on the list.

100
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,384
It can't hurt to put your name down.

101
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:20,286
lf, in two years, you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

102
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:23,360
I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

103
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,196
I'm gonna do it too.

104
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:26,365
Me too!

105
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:30,935
-Really? Who would you marry?
-I don't have anyone right now.

106
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:32,195
Oh, Pheebs.

107
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,866
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

108
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,543
Phoebe, that's not--

109
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,647
Don't even get me started on yours.

110
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,986
-Did you watch the tape of my show?
-I did.

111
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:51,919
-Let's get me back up there.
-You don't go up on the wall.

112
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:58,290
-What? But you saw the show.
-It was very offensive to my people.

113
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,893
Dry cleaners?

114
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,903
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.

115
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:10,508
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!

116
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,008
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

117
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,477
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring nothing!

118
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,247
Okay, that may be true.

119
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,648
But in <i>Air Force One</i>, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil!

120
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,291
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

121
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:29,053
-I've never seen it.
-You should. It's great!

122
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,892
This place is really beautiful.

123
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:41,039
I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

124
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,472
The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes.

125
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,572
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.

126
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,614
But people say that my eyes look....

127
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,441
Do you wanna make out?

128
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,176
Sure.

129
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,386
Are you okay?

130
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,053
What's wrong?

131
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,526
Yeah. I was just thinking
about your father.

132
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,356
Well, whatever works for you.

133
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,066
No.

134
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:14,835
He just really freaked me out before.

135
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,340
So we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

136
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,603
Big deal.

137
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,906
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

138
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,439
Yeah.

139
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,145
-Yeah?
-You brought protection, right?

140
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:33,018
Why, are there, like, bears or something?

141
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:41,389
Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
That-- That I forgot.

142
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,638
I can't believe I brought two cans
of bug spray and forgot that.

143
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:52,441
-I'll run to the store and get some.
-I'm the guy. I'll get it.

144
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:55,239
-Do you know where the store is?
-No.

145
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,815
Do you wanna ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

146
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:01,443
A little bit.

147
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:06,987
I'll be back in 10 minutes. Get in
the hot tub and I'll meet you there.

148
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:08,516
Okay.

149
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:26,869
Oh, my God! What a great surprise!
This is such a beautiful house!

150
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,675
Thank you. It used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.

151
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,819
-Hey, Chandler.
-Hey, Joe.

152
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,029
Everybody's gotta be doing something.

153
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,231
<i>You've reached Monica and Chandler's.</i>

154
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:54,237
<i>If you're listening to this message,</i>
<i>we're probably screening.</i>

155
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,668
Yeah, we are.

156
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,768
<i>Hi, this is Hildy</i>
<i>from the Morgan Chase Museum.</i>

157
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,972
<i>I'm calling for Monica Geller. I wanted to</i>
<i>let her know that there was a cancellation.</i>

158
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,211
<i>If she's still interested in having the</i>
<i>Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...</i>

159
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,048
<i>...it is available</i>--

160
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,052
This is Chandler Bing!
This is Chandler Bing!

161
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:14,920
Yes, the groom.

162
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,493
No, not the groom!

163
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,696
It's so secluded up here.

164
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,903
I know. That's why I like it here.

165
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:30,198
I feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

166
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,134
Sorry.

167
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,280
What's the matter, honey?

168
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:43,881
-Did you see a little mouse?
-No! Big bear! Big bear outside!

169
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,046
I think I....

170
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:49,888
-Actually, would you go check on that?
-We don't have any bears here.

171
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,357
Well, okay.

172
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:53,531
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

173
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,997
-Okay. Be right back.
-Okay.

174
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,743
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

175
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:08,004
-I came with Paul!
-Yeah. I recognized the ankles.

176
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,781
-Where is Elizabeth?
-She's at the store.

177
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,953
-You make the girl go to the store?
-Do I know where the store is?

178
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:17,980
Hurry up. Get out.

179
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,515
Here you go, honey.

180
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:24,262
-Thank you!
-Diet Coke.

181
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,520
Ice.

182
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,690
I need ice.

183
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,659
Okay.

184
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,604
-Thank you.
-Be right back.

185
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:34,773
Okay.

186
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,574
You and your ice.

187
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,973
Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!

188
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,111
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

189
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,481
-Did you really hear a bear?
-Go!

190
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,550
Here you go, honey.

191
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,164
One Diet Coke with ice.

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,131
Thank you.

193
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,634
I am so happy that you're here.

194
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,567
-Here I am!
-Elizabeth!

195
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,838
Look! Elizabeth's here!

196
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,572
Who were you talking to?

197
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,010
You guys?

198
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,111
How did you know we were here?

199
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,451
She obviously saw the tire tracks
leading up to the closed garage.

200
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,054
Obviously.

201
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,127
What are you doing here?

202
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:44,133
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

203
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,468
Yeah.

204
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:49,038
Well, why don't you go in that room
and do your homework?

205
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:52,749
I wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.

206
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,286
That's your dad's bedroom.

207
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,023
That's your dad's bedroom!

208
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,290
Why are you yelling?

209
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,461
That Diet Coke, I think,
just straight to my head!

210
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,700
Hi, honey.

211
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,069
See you later.

212
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,906
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.

213
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,511
Well, next time, ask!

214
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,977
Or at least wait for me to ask!

215
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:41,499
<i>Hi, this is Hildy</i>
<i>from the Morgan Chase Museum.</i>

216
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,602
-<i>I'm calling for Monica Geller.</i>
-Oh, no.

217
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,567
<i>I wanted to let her know</i>
<i>that there was a cancellation.</i>

218
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,335
<i>If she's still interested in having</i>
<i>the Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...</i>

219
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:52,738
<i>...it is available....</i>

220
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,640
Please. He didn't hear it!

221
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,441
<i>This is Chandler Bing!</i>
<i>This is Chandler Bing!</i>

222
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,276
No!

223
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,187
Can I help you?

224
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:09,159
Yeah, where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

225
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:12,364
-He's not here right now.
-You're kidding me!

226
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:16,796
Make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani
stopped by to drop off all these clothes.

227
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,801
I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
my picture on the wall.

228
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,800
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

229
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,836
Oh, really?

230
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:30,910
Well, maybe you and I go out
for drinks.

231
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,181
You're the other one, right?

232
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,920
So, Lizzie, are you planning on
staying the night?

233
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:42,693
No, no. Believe me,
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

234
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:47,792
Good. Not that we don't want you
to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.

235
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,127
How much more homework
do you have?

236
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:54,966
I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.

237
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:58,507
Rachel, maybe you wanna come
upstairs and help me figure it out?

238
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:00,035
Really?

239
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,838
Okay.

240
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,178
Okay, I'll go upstairs...

241
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,116
...if you get me something
from the car.

242
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,289
What do you need from the car?

243
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,046
Surprise me.

244
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:15,516
Okay.

245
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,726
So you're gonna be in the car!
I will be upstairs!

246
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,025
That's where everybody's gonna be!

247
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,959
Just relax. Relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

248
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,353
She likes you.

249
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:54,064
I think she likes you. She likes you.

250
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,063
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

251
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,133
You are the man.

252
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,834
You are the man!

253
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,443
Still got it.

254
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:12,848
Still sexy.

255
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:16,116
You're just a love machine.

256
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:34,837
Showtime.

257
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,404
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

258
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,345
-Have you seen Chandler?
-No, why?

259
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:48,349
The museum called and said
that there was a cancellation...

260
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:51,648
...and that we could move up our
wedding. And Chandler heard.

261
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,858
I know. How bad is this?

262
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,857
Well, with a regular guy, it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God!

263
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,862
I know! And he totally freaked out.
I can't find him anywhere!

264
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:06,232
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm never going to listen to you again.

265
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,272
"What harm can it do
if you put your name down?"

266
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,340
-Rachel said that.
-Well, Rachel's not here!

267
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,983
You really think she put
your picture up already?

268
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:24,019
Did she put my picture up?

269
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,817
You kidding, after the date we had?

270
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,892
I wouldn't be surprised if she put
10 of my pictures up there.

271
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:33,657
Except for the fact that I only gave her one.
I don't know where she'd get the other nine.

272
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:37,935
Here it is!

273
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,171
Joey, why did you sign it
"son of a bitch"?

274
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,746
-I didn't do that. Who would do that?
-Son of a bitch!

275
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,171
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

276
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:53,844
-You! Get out of my shop!
-What did he do?

277
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,180
-He went out with my wife!
-Joey!

278
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,717
I did not go out with your wife! Okay?

279
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:02,526
I went out with her.

280
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,628
That's my wife!

281
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:08,695
I'm not pointing at her, no.
I'm pointing at her.

282
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,835
"Zelda McMurray."

283
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,329
Who the hell--?
How did she get up there?!

284
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:15,565
Get out!

285
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,644
-Well, we should go.
-Yeah.

286
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:24,039
Ross?

287
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:29,549
Elizabeth!

288
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:37,028
Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.

289
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,866
I'll meet you at the front door.
Tell them you're going home.

290
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,500
-Okay.
-Wait! No, don't go in there!

291
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,460
Don't go in there!
I need another soda!

292
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,764
Ross!

293
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:54,234
Oh, my God, Ross!
What in heaven's name are you doing here?

294
00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:00,607
And that is why
we cannot see each other anymore.

295
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:07,218
Ross, you and I are gonna have
to have a little talk.

296
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:08,620
-Daddy, l--
-You're next!

297
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,819
Okay. I didn't know he was here.

298
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,997
Let me just see if I got this straight.

299
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:19,501
I tell you to stay away from
my daughter or I'll have you fired.

300
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:22,071
What you heard was:
"Take my daughter...

301
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:25,176
...come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel."

302
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:30,174
-Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
-No! Let me explain! Fired!

303
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,312
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

304
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,415
But I want you to know...

305
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:43,653
...that you and I are not
all that different. I mean...

306
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,591
...I, too, am a "neat guy."

307
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:57,334
What?

308
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,069
And I, too...

309
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,842
...am "just a love machine."

310
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:30,607
-Let me show you the guest room.
-Okay.

311
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,555
I'm so sorry.
Please stop freaking out.

312
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,116
I'm not freaking out.

313
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:53,124
Why would I? A woman named Hildy called
and said we were getting married.

314
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:55,162
But that happens every day.

315
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:01,398
Honey, we were at
this beautiful place...

316
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,666
...and I just put our names down for fun.

317
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:06,640
-I mean, what's the harm in that?
-Right here.

318
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,842
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

319
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,349
-Phoebe and Rachel thought--
-Phoebe and Rachel?

320
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,920
So the people that knew about
our wedding before me were you...

321
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:22,719
...Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy, and some
band called the Starlight Magic Seven...

322
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:25,055
...who are available, by the way.

323
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,599
It was a mistake.

324
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:32,428
Please don't take this to mean
anything, because it doesn't.

325
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,299
Okay.

326
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,301
Really?

327
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:42,940
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know I'm not ready.

328
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:44,137
I know.

329
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:45,709
I know.

330
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:47,610
Okay.

331
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,612
All right.

332
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:52,484
I'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.

333
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:55,483
We were really worried about you.

334
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,856
And that guy that
never delivered his burrito?

335
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,531
He thought there was
some sort of connection.

336
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,196
Did she buy it?

337
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:08,830
Totally.

338
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,272
-So did Hildy show you the place?
-Yeah. It's beautiful.

339
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,507
I can't believe
you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.

340
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:17,773
I know.

341
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,521
-Hey, Gunther.
-Take these cappuccinos to table 11.

342
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,326
And that guy wants some biscotti.

343
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,963
I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee.

344
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:43,369
Do you still work here?

345
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,304
No. I quit a long time ago.

346
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,672
Did I forget to tell you that?
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,810
-Cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
-Great!
