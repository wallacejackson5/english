1
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:05,684
Monica, which of all of this
kitchen stuff is mine?

2
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:07,910
This bottle opener.

3
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:11,123
-And...?
-And it's a magnet.

4
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:17,995
Look at that!

5
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,299
How weird is that?
You're moving in with me...

6
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:24,629
...and you have the one thing
I don't have.

7
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,775
It's like, in a way,
you complete me.

8
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:33,678
-Kitchen.
-What?

9
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:36,507
You complete me kitchen, matey!

10
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:40,644
I know what you're thinking.

11
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,523
That she'll move in with you, then
fall in love with you, and then...

12
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:49,489
...when she finds out you're already
married, she'll be happy.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,631
You know? You're just very sad.

14
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,394
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:57,304 --> 00:01:02,207
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel!

16
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:07,374
It all adds up! You're obsessed
with her. It's always:

17
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:11,574
"What will you do about Rachel?
Why are you moving in with Rachel?

18
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:16,653
When will you confess your secret
marriage to Rachel?" You want her!

19
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,823
Saved by the bell.

20
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:27,663
Aren't these candlesticks mine?

21
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:29,198
No, I bought those.

22
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:30,863
Oh, right. I forgot.

23
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:34,030
That you're a liar!

24
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:40,477
That's great! I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.

25
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:45,582
That was the head
of the paleontology department...

26
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,011
...at N...

27
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:48,312
...Y...

28
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:49,648
...U.

29
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:51,554
Wow. What...

30
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:52,759
...did he...

31
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:54,720
...say?

32
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:59,892
Remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?

33
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,533
-They loved it.
-Well, who wouldn't?

34
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:04,529
I know!

35
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:09,406
Anyway, they asked me
to be a guest lecturer.

36
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,203
It's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.

37
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,882
How great would that look
on the mailbox? Professor Geller.

38
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,879
Professor and Mrs.

39
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:23,350
And Mrs.?

40
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,218
You and Ross are still married.

41
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:30,088
What?

42
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,856
Just kidding!

43
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,458
Oh, God!

44
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,366
Saved your ass.

45
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,712
The One Where Joey Loses His Insurance

46
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:25,845
What's the matter?

47
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:30,149
You know that psychic I see?

48
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:33,823
She told me I'm gonna die this week,
so I'm bummed.

49
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:41,225
I know you don't know about readings,
but that's the worst you can get.

50
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:43,996
That's crazy.

51
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:45,728
She'd say that to you?

52
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:47,701
You don't believe her, do you?

53
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:50,809
I don't know. She said
that I'd have triplets...

54
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,808
...but she also said one of them
would be black.

55
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:58,007
Just out of curiosity,
did she say how you'd go?

56
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,914
She didn't tell me I'd die
till the end of the session.

57
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,552
I wasn't gonna waste
a whole other hour there!

58
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,655
I've only got a week left.

59
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,292
I've really gotta start living now!

60
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,555
Hey, everyone.

61
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,366
Well, today's my first lecture...

62
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,572
...and I wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?

63
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,704
No, that'd be great!

64
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:39,589
"There are three primary theories
concerning sediment flow rate.

65
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:43,420
Each of these theories can be further
subcategorized into two..."

66
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:46,564
This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.

67
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:54,430
" ...subcategories. The first
of these subcategories is--"

68
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:57,804
Are there naked chicks
on that piece of paper?

69
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:01,536
No. Why?

70
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:05,740
I never seen a guy stare so hard at
something that didn't have chicks on it.

71
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:16,726
"There are three primary theories...

72
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,965
...concerning sediment flow rate.

73
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,434
Each of these theories...

74
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:28,606
...can be further subcategorized...

75
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:29,764
...into--"

76
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:32,035
Why don't you open with a joke?

77
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,974
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,115
Wait a minute, hold the phone.

79
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,247
You're not talking
about Chuckles University?

80
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,323
Come on, we're kidding.

81
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,594
You know what might make it
less boring?

82
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:49,920
Thank you.

83
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,957
Some visual aids.

84
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,863
-You know what's a good visual aid?
-Don't say naked chicks.

85
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:59,302
Why not?

86
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:02,868
I don't even know why I talk
to you guys about it.

87
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:06,442
I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.

88
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:09,341
That's the way I did it
till I was 19.

89
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:12,842
All right, 20.

90
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,585
Twenty-three.

91
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,091
Any good mail?

92
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,198
Something from
the Screen Actors Guild.

93
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,530
It's probably a residual check.
Can you open it? I got....

94
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,970
"Benefits lapsed."

95
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,367
That's weird.

96
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:39,704
I don't remember being in a movie
called <i>Benefits Lapsed.</i>

97
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:44,875
It's not a check. Your health
insurance expired because...

98
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,643
-...you didn't work enough last year.
-Let me see that.

99
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:51,814
Oh, I can't believe this!

100
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,389
This sucks!

101
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:57,263
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus...

102
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,261
...or catch on fire, you know?

103
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,296
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?

104
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:06,161
I'm sorry. There's never
a good time to have to...

105
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,634
...stop catching on fire.

106
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:11,574
All right, well...

107
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,176
...I guess I gotta go see my agent.

108
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:17,383
Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street.

109
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:21,311
"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street."

110
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,727
Hey, you're still alive!

111
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,896
How are you feeling?

112
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,365
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.

113
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,572
Oh, by the way, do you think you--

114
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,472
What are you doing?

115
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,546
Preparing you for--
Didn't you think I was dead?

116
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,477
Did that not come off?

117
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:55,080
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.

118
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,256
-You wanna lie down?
-Yeah, thanks.

119
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:00,348
Can you do me a favor?

120
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:02,618
Wake me up in a couple hours.

121
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,727
You know, if you can.

122
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,763
Did you take these back?

123
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,802
I liked them so much
that I bought some for myself.

124
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,241
They're really great, aren't they?

125
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:23,540
I love them.

126
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,110
Nice try.

127
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,049
How'd the lecture go?

128
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,292
It went great.

129
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:37,462
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.

130
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:40,756
That's great. I'm sorry
we weren't supportive before.

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,992
I knew I just had to let
the material speak for itself.

132
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,330
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have
to be funny and sexy."

133
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,768
Well, I proved them wrong!

134
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,778
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.

135
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,709
-That you're not funny or sexy?
-That's right!

136
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:06,156
-Hey, Estelle, listen--
-Well, well, well.

137
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:07,959
Joey Tribbiani.

138
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,286
So you came back, huh?

139
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:13,031
They think they can do better,
but they all...

140
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,097
...come crawling back to Estelle.

141
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:19,595
What are you talking about?

142
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,507
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.

143
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,367
Really?

144
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,339
Oh, well, no harm no foul.

145
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:33,180
Look, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.

146
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,717
All right, first thing we gotta do:
damage control.

147
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,356
-Why?
-Well, I think...

148
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,753
...someone out there...

149
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:45,394
...may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.

150
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,661
The bastard!

151
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:55,440
We're early.
The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.

152
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,974
-But we could sneak in and watch.
-Yeah, we could.

153
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:02,103
Hey, look. There's some
Kappa Kappa Deltas. I was a Kappa.

154
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,273
Hey, sisters.

155
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:09,114
Wow, we really are bitches.

156
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:16,194
Right. So when Rigby got his samples
back from the laboratory...

157
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:19,796
...he made a startling discovery.

158
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:26,100
What he believed to be igneous
was, in fact, sedimentary.

159
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,966
Imagine his consternation when--

160
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,010
Oh, bloody hell.

161
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,857
So Estelle lined up a bunch
of auditions for me tomorrow.

162
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:53,032
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.

163
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,763
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?

164
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,804
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

165
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:09,640
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

166
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:12,908
And then I passed out...

167
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:15,210
...and I haven't been able
to stand up since.

168
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,352
But I don't think
it's anything serious.

169
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,425
This sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

170
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:27,394
No way. If I go to the doctor, it'll be for
this thing sticking out of my stomach!

171
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:32,799
That's a hernia.

172
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,734
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

173
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,305
Damn you, 15s!

174
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,080
What the hell are you doing?

175
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:45,243
Look, I was nervous.

176
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:48,318
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.

177
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:51,955
I got up there and they were
all, like, staring at me.

178
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,957
I opened my mouth and this
British accent just came out.

179
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:58,787
Yeah, and not a very good one.

180
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,863
Will you, please...?

181
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:02,897
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.

182
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,660
I'm a paleontology professor here.

183
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:08,796
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?

184
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,839
I'm sorry, I've got plans
with my sister.

185
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,079
Monica Geller.

186
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:18,980
Right. Will you excuse us
for one moment?

187
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,148
-What are you doing?
-You can have an accent, but I can't?

188
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,313
Top of the morning to you, laddies!

189
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,260
Would you just please stop?

190
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.

191
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,216
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?

192
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,179
Sit down!

193
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,414
Will you go to the hospital?

194
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,419
Hernia operations cost...

195
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:02,320
...a lot probably, okay?

196
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:07,124
Besides, it's getting darker and more
painful. That means it's healing.

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,831
Look, I'll loan you the money.

198
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,402
Just go to the hospital and
let's just get that thing...

199
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,196
...pushed back in.

200
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:19,036
Thank you, but it'd take me
forever to pay you back.

201
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:21,303
I don't want that
hanging over my head.

202
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,709
Besides, when my
insurance kicks in...

203
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,850
...I can get all the free
operations I want.

204
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,155
I'll probably start
with that laser eye surgery.

205
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:35,260
What's going on?

206
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:40,396
Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing
a little laser eye surgery won't fix.

207
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,097
I'm telling you,
if I put my hand on my stomach...

208
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,531
...it doesn't hurt that bad.

209
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:48,736
Hey, maybe you'll die!

210
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:53,142
Chandler, I'm scared.

211
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:55,138
No, we can go together.

212
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:59,317
Just don't wait too long, because I'm
out of here sometime before Friday.

213
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,976
But I don't want to die.

214
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:05,381
It'll be fun. We'll come back
and haunt these guys!

215
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:11,052
Wait. Could I come back and haunt Monica
and Rachel when they're in the shower?

216
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,765
-That's my girlfriend.
-Hey, I'm dead!

217
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,168
-Give me them!
-No, they are mine!

218
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,468
-You stole them from me!
-You stole them from me!

219
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:26,770
Give me them!

220
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,447
Just wanna each take one?

221
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:34,676
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.

222
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:39,481
Look, I really need
some help, okay?

223
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,159
Why did I have to speak
in a British accent?

224
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:44,818
What do I do?

225
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,330
Why don't you call
Mummy and Daddy?

226
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:52,528
I'm serious! Someone's gonna find out and
then they're never gonna offer me a job.

227
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,832
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.

228
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:58,340
People will think you're
adjusting to life in America.

229
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,769
Come on.
No one will even notice.

230
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,448
They're probably not even
listening to you.

231
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:06,974
They're not listening to me?

232
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,811
Of course they're listening to you.

233
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:11,822
Everybody listens to you.

234
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:15,622
Monica, do you think I should
try this phasing-out thing?

235
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,418
I think you look fine.

236
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,025
Whenever you're ready.

237
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,301
Hey, Timmy.

238
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:29,941
I've got a surprise...

239
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,302
...for you.

240
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:32,868
Hold it.
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,215
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.

242
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,350
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.

243
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:41,449
Just hold on one second.

244
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,252
Hey, Timmy.

245
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,761
I've got a surprise for you!

246
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,022
Oh, my God!

247
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,503
So that's why I feed my dog
Purina One.

248
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,838
Pick up a bag today.

249
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,341
-That's where you pick up the bag.
-Exactly.

250
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:16,477
The line is, "Pick up a bag,"
so you need to pick up the bag.

251
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:19,714
Or I could just point to it.

252
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:25,052
Purina One. Point to a bag today.

253
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:30,702
I didn't get it, did I?

254
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:38,576
Joey Tribbiani.

255
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:41,108
I'm here to audition for "Man."

256
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,541
You mean "Dying Man."

257
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:51,248
-Do it one more time.
-Really? Really? Okay.

258
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:59,455
Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely
from the Fake Accent University.

259
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,132
We'd like you
to come onboard full-time!

260
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,870
Listen to this!

261
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,669
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.

262
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:13,208
Really? How do you know?

263
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:14,879
My psychic is dead!

264
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,084
She must have read
the cards wrong.

265
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,876
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,781
Better her than me.

267
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,390
Hey, let's bake cookies!

268
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:33,461
Listen, I'm really glad
you got the part.

269
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,064
Are you sure you can do this?

270
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,467
And thanks for coming with me.

271
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:42,640
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.

272
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,345
Now, is that
"never talking about it again"?

273
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,108
We're ready for you.

274
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:55,446
This is Alex.
He'll be playing your son.

275
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:56,779
Hi, Alex.

276
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,991
As you can see, my hands
are not in my pants.

277
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,790
All right, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line...

278
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,729
..."Take good care of your mama, son,"
that's your cue to cry. Got it?

279
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:13,437
All right, let's do this.

280
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,972
Scene five, take one.

281
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:22,776
And action!

282
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:25,246
Take good care of your mama, son.

283
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:35,653
Take good care of your mama, son.

284
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:40,691
Come on, son.

285
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,361
Your mama's good people.

286
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:48,172
Cut! Alex, remember, you're
supposed to cry.

287
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,534
Can you cry for us this time?

288
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:53,011
All right. From the top.

289
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:58,148
Scene five, take two.

290
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,681
Take 36 is up.

291
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,345
Let's try this again.

292
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:04,848
You ready, Joe?

293
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:07,820
One thing, is it all right
if I scream...

294
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,961
...right up until
you say, "Action"?

295
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,297
Sure.

296
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:17,460
-Action!
-Take good care of your mama, son.

297
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:21,332
Cut!

298
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:26,877
I'm sorry. Why don't you lift up your
shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo.

299
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:34,349
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!

300
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,528
-Hello, is Ross there?
-No, he's not. Can I take a message?

301
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:46,264
<i>Yes, this is Russell,</i>
<i>Ross' divorce lawyer.</i>

302
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:50,901
Since I haven't heard from him, I
assume he's giving the marriage a try.

303
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:52,961
Ross got married again?

304
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:00,208
<i>All right, keep going.</i>
<i>We are phasing the accent out.</i>

305
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,073
<i>Phasing it out.</i>

306
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:07,218
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory...

307
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,948
...the team would never
have identified...

308
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:17,652
...the initial errors
in their carbon dating...

309
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,488
...analysis."

310
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,792
Were there any questions
at this point?

311
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,672
What's happening to your accent?

312
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:33,445
Come again? What's this nonsense?

313
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:40,280
All right. I'm not English.

314
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,855
I'm from Long Island.

315
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:47,783
I was really nervous,
and the accent...

316
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,551
...just came out.

317
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,552
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:56,368
So if we could just
get back to the lecture.

319
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,399
Were there any questions?

320
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,602
About paleontology?

321
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,675
I was just trying to make
a good first impression.

322
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,114
Obviously, I screwed up. But what
you guys think of me is important...

323
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:18,379
...because I'm hoping to get
a permanent job here.

324
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:22,889
So if you'd just give me another
chance to make a good impression--

325
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:25,723
Ross! Are you crazy?

326
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:29,092
I am still your wife?
Were you just never gonna tell me?

327
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,598
What the hell is wrong with you?

328
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,929
I could just kill you!

329
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,040
Well, hello, Rachel!

330
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,648
You've really done this before?

331
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,985
You just take a big, big swing, okay?

332
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,024
Now, don't hold back.

333
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:02,933
What are you doing?

334
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:06,762
We're just celebrating that Joey
got his health insurance back.

335
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,629
Oh, all right.

336
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:17,345
See? Now let's try one without the helmet.
