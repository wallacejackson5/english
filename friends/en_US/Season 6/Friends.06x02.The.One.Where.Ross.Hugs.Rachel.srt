1
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:07,050
Did everything go okay
with the annulment?

2
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:09,652
No problems.
It's all taken care of.

3
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:11,050
Ross, thank you.

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,283
Want to go see a movie?

5
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:15,495
Yeah, why not?

6
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,219
I'll get my sweater.

7
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,225
Want to hear something weird?

8
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:23,733
Always.

9
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,498
I didn't get the annulment.

10
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:29,834
What?

11
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:31,442
We're still married.

12
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:34,906
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

13
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:40,244
Do you have any gum?

14
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:46,224
Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just
talk to you for just a second?

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,155
We'll be late for the movie.

16
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:50,225
There's a cab. Taxi!

17
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:52,556
That's great.

18
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,394
What timing! My God, huh?
There you go.

19
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:58,798
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.

20
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:00,437
The Angelika! Go! Go!

21
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,405
You didn't get the annulment?!

22
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,272
I know.

23
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:11,249
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:

24
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:13,976
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"

25
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:17,486
Yes, in that high voice.

26
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:22,219
I just don't want my tombstone to read:
"Ross Geller: Three Divorces."

27
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:26,057
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
can say whatever you want.

28
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,995
It can say,
"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."

29
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,370
You know? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."

30
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:38,467
All I know is, I can't have
another failed marriage.

31
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:42,580
So you're gonna be married to
a girl who doesn't even know about it?

32
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,646
Woman. Sorry.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,689
Okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.

34
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:52,288
Just don't say anything to Rachel.

35
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:55,495
Rachel is one of my closest friends.

36
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:59,926
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.

37
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:05,304
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?

38
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:06,904
Hey, Rach!

39
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,632
What was that?

40
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,468
Sorry. Mix-up.

41
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:13,876
How was the movie?

42
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:16,479
I haven't seen it yet.

43
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,843
You'd better hurry.
The Angelika! Go!

44
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:24,481
The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel

45
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,664
When I move in,
can I get a gumball machine?

46
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:08,833
Of course. Joey wouldn't
let you have one?

47
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:12,401
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.

48
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,499
Did you tell him you're moving out?

49
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:19,074
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out, "Joey, I have to--"

50
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:23,248
Then I lose my nerve and I finish
with, "--go to the bathroom."

51
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,317
He may think I'm sick.

52
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:29,778
I have to tell Rachel, but....
We just gotta get it over with.

53
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:33,220
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.

54
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,623
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?

55
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,362
-Pretty much.
-All right.

56
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,532
Hey, man, you feeling better?

57
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,169
We have something to tell you.

58
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,473
Oh, my God!

59
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,407
You're pregnant!

60
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,709
No!

61
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:03,319
Look, Joe, here's the thing.

62
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:09,124
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.

63
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:11,987
I'm gonna be moving out, man.

64
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,503
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.

65
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:25,636
Are you okay?

66
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:28,313
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.

67
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,711
Like you'd believe that.

68
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,746
This sucks!

69
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:37,882
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you...

70
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:41,685
...the minute Monica and I break up,
I'm moving right back in.

71
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:45,162
Maybe that's now.

72
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,690
If you're gonna move in with him...

73
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:51,268
...I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.

74
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,664
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.

75
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,602
He forgets to....

76
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,904
He always, he always....

77
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,947
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!

78
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,050
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Hey.

79
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:12,986
Oh, look, here's an article about people
who marry people and don't tell them.

80
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,686
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm reading <i>Ross Geller Magazine</i>.

81
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:19,988
Have you seen Rachel?

82
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,396
-No, why?
-I have some exciting news.

83
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,062
You're pregnant.

84
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,929
No!

85
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,839
Chandler and I are moving in together.

86
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,634
Oh, that's good!

87
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:35,576
But if you were pregnant,
what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.

88
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:40,748
What's up?

89
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:45,156
Chandler and I are moving in together.

90
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,519
Oh, my God.

91
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,388
Oh, my little sister
and my best friend...

92
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,223
...shacking up.

93
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,232
That's great. That's great.

94
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,337
Guys, I'm happy too.

95
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,038
Okay, come here.

96
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:06,570
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.

97
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,614
I gotta go find Rachel.

98
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:16,220
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.

99
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,991
Something bad to tell Rachel.

100
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:26,197
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?

101
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,731
Can you just lay off, please?

102
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:34,531
My life is an embarrassment. I should
just go live under somebody's stairs.

103
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,833
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.

104
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,138
You'll have a life, you'll date--

105
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:45,545
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.

106
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:48,548
The only guys below me
will be Four-Divorce Guy...

107
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:50,823
...Murderer Guy...

108
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,752
...and geologists.

109
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:58,120
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.

110
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:01,526
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.

111
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,703
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?

112
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:09,238
That's not fair. Most guys that have
been divorced three times are 60.

113
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,740
You're young.

114
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,140
That's true, I am young.

115
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:18,181
Well....

116
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,653
Nobody cares about this except you.

117
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:25,221
This embarrassment thing is
all in your head.

118
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,956
-Here, I'll show you. Come here.
-What?

119
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,325
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.

120
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,056
But wouldn't you date him?

121
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:39,328
And if you wait right here,
I'll go get Ross.

122
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:45,471
Thought you were Rachel.

123
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,743
What gave me away?

124
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:49,576
I gotta tell her.

125
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:52,013
I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.

126
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:54,846
It's official.
We're moving in together.

127
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:58,488
No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?!

128
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:00,681
No.

129
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,985
That was my scariest voice.
You're brave.

130
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:08,993
The worst day.

131
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,831
You're finally making progress at work,
then your boss calls you Racquel.

132
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:19,170
Listen, for the first four years
of my work, everybody called me....

133
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,509
-Seriously.
-I believe you.

134
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:32,989
It was in the middle of a meeting,
so no one wants to correct her.

135
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:34,888
So everyone's calling me Racquel.

136
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:38,824
By the end of the day, the mailroom
guys were calling me Rocky.

137
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,027
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.

138
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:46,062
What?

139
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,297
All yours, babe.

140
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,336
Have a seat.

141
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,713
Listen, Chandler and I...

142
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:00,349
...are going to live together.

143
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,709
Here.

144
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:06,150
Oh, my God.

145
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,194
That's so great!

146
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:13,364
I'm so happy for you guys!

147
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:14,658
Really?

148
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,232
And that was so sweet of you to ask.

149
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,372
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!

150
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,302
Yes, we are.

151
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:28,575
Chandler, you'll have to watch
those long showers you take...

152
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,750
...because you know
Racquel can't be late.

153
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,747
He'll work on that.

154
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,253
This is so exciting!

155
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,726
<i>Come and knock on our door</i>

156
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,125
<i>We'll be waiting for you</i>

157
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,432
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.

158
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:01,205
First marriage: Wife's hidden
sexuality. Not my fault.

159
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:05,317
Second marriage:
Said the wrong name at the altar.

160
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:07,279
A little my fault.

161
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:11,648
Third marriage: They shouldn't
let you get married...

162
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,324
...when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.

163
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,051
Nevada's fault.

164
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,589
So what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?

165
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,267
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.

166
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:26,004
But not while he's still married.

167
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,263
And you, wouldn't you want to date?

168
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,476
I'm not dating at all anymore.

169
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,304
I was only dating guys
that were bad for me.

170
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,013
So I decided that--

171
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,613
Good. Good. Whatever.

172
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:39,008
And you, Meg?

173
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:42,016
Well, I don't care about
the divorces, either.

174
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,382
But I wouldn't date him.

175
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,390
Normally, he doesn't sweat this much.

176
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:52,324
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.

177
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:53,691
What?

178
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:57,461
She said, "He's obviously still
in love with this Rachel girl."

179
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:03,571
This is crazy. I mean, yes,
Rachel is my good friend.

180
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,438
And I have loved her in the past...

181
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,977
...but now, she is just my wife.

182
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,411
Phoebe, will you help me out here?

183
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:16,645
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.

184
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:21,359
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.

185
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,058
You could do a lot worse
than Joey Tribbiani!

186
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,398
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

187
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,866
I just don't want
to be divorced three times.

188
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,370
Now he's using
this three-divorces reason...

189
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,872
...because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.

190
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,579
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.

191
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:46,241
Fine. If this is what you think,
forget about...

192
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,009
...the whole three-divorce thing.

193
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:52,588
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
and get this marriage annulled.

194
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,453
She means nothing to me.

195
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,592
Nothing!

196
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:02,197
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.

197
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,729
I am so attracted to him right now.

198
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:12,976
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?

199
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,135
Soon.

200
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:17,180
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.

201
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,715
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.

202
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,419
Joey's my best friend.

203
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,246
I'm not your best friend?

204
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:27,022
You just said--

205
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:30,753
Of course you're my best friend.

206
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:32,959
Would you tell Rachel?

207
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,363
All right. At least I'm prepared.

208
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:39,470
Oh, yes.

209
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:44,204
-They're not for you. Are you upset?
-I am now.

210
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,546
Hey, roomie.

211
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,609
Okay, bye.

212
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,249
There's something important
I have to tell you.

213
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:00,789
Are you pregnant?

214
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,859
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.

215
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:08,862
I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.

216
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:14,463
When I said that Chandler and I
wanted to live together...

217
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:17,910
...we meant alone together.

218
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:25,111
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.

219
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:28,080
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.

220
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:29,913
I wasn't clear.

221
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,147
I'm really sorry.

222
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:36,361
Listen, you take as much time
as you need to move out, okay?

223
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,325
There's absolutely no rush.

224
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:40,794
Okay.

225
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,331
Don't you want a cookie?

226
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:51,436
Sure.

227
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,038
Thanks.

228
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,646
Do you need a tissue?

229
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,154
-Where did you get these?
-I made them.

230
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:06,118
Oh, God, they're so yummy!

231
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,655
-Okay, whose is this?
-That's mine.

232
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,163
-And what about this? Whose is this?
-That's mine.

233
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,598
Okay, whose dishwashing soap is this?

234
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,103
That was here when we moved in.

235
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,674
Oh, I guess it really is concentrated.

236
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:31,872
It's gonna be weird when I come home
and you're not here.

237
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,914
No more Joey and Chan's.

238
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,347
No more J and C's.

239
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,054
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't. It's not there.

240
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:44,394
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.

241
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,463
We won't be able to have
those long talks at night...

242
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,635
...about our feelings and the future.

243
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,260
Not once did we do that.

244
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:57,137
Don't you remember that night,
it was late and I was feeling sick...

245
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,304
...and you said
I would feel better tomorrow?

246
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:04,110
Oh, yeah. I remember that.

247
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,381
I don't know.
I'm just gonna miss living with you.

248
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,579
Yeah, me too, man.

249
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:14,250
-What the hell is that?
-That's disgusting.

250
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,991
I told Rachel that it's just
gonna be the two of us.

251
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,565
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?

252
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:25,330
Really well.

253
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,662
Surprisingly well.

254
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,171
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.

255
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,516
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?

256
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,649
All I'm asking for is
a little emotion.

257
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,979
Is that too much to ask
after six years?

258
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:46,019
What, are Rachel and I
not as close as you guys?

259
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:50,355
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?

260
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:53,788
When we told Joey,
he cried his eyes out.

261
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:57,795
I did not cry my eyes out!

262
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,498
Come on, it's like the end of an era.

263
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,571
No more J-Man and Channy's!

264
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,807
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?

265
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:15,647
You got married again?

266
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:17,778
Yes.

267
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:22,182
So that's your second marriage
in two years?

268
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:24,793
Yes. Second in two years.

269
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:27,363
Third, overall.

270
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,864
I have been a divorce attorney
for 23 years...

271
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:34,197
...and never have I had
so much business from one client.

272
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,975
Why don't you tell me what happened?

273
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,679
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.

274
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:47,250
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
whose name you said...

275
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,350
...at the altar
in the second marriage?

276
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,249
Yes, yes, yes.

277
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:53,591
But I do not love her.

278
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:56,721
That's better then.

279
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:01,633
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.

280
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:02,890
I see.

281
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,996
Have you considered therapy?

282
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:11,707
I think just the annulment for today.

283
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,309
-There are some forms to fill out.
-Easy.

284
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,983
We'll need witnesses who can testify
that you were not of sound mind.

285
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,049
No problem.

286
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:24,482
We'll need you and Rachel
to testify before a judge.

287
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,458
There's no way to do this without her?

288
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,598
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.

289
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,791
Of course you did.

290
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:43,073
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.

291
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,038
What about someone
who looks like Rachel?

292
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:51,583
I will think about the therapy.

293
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:03,591
So I was thinking that maybe we
should start dividing up our stuff.

294
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:05,695
Okay.

295
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,130
No point in dragging it out.

296
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:11,862
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out...

297
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,198
...and us not living together anymore.

298
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,805
What about this? Who gets this?

299
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,780
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.

300
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:30,978
-What is that?
-I don't know.

301
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:37,426
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.

302
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:41,695
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.

303
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,831
Something to remember me by.

304
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:48,766
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.

305
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,199
We're gonna see each other
all the time.

306
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:55,378
But still, it's a big change.

307
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:58,811
The end of an era, you might say.

308
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,517
Are you okay? You're not blinking.

309
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:08,921
I'm fine. I was thinking about
how it's an end of an era.

310
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,953
Oh, all right.

311
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:16,996
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.

312
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:20,136
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.

313
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,773
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!

314
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:27,377
-What is the matter with you?
-What is the matter with you?!

315
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,372
Why aren't you more upset?

316
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,675
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?

317
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,919
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?

318
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:39,088
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.

319
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:43,420
It's just a little hard to believe.

320
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,595
What's hard to believe?

321
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:50,029
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?

322
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:54,332
You were gonna get married in Vegas,
and then you backed out.

323
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:59,010
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.

324
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,108
It's going to happen.

325
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:08,917
Chandler will move in here.

326
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:12,055
-But l--
-I know, just let me finish, okay?

327
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,758
This isn't something that we just
impulsively decided to do in Vegas.

328
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,487
This is something
that we both really want.

329
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,666
And it is going to happen.

330
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,902
It is?

331
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:29,404
Really?

332
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,503
Yeah, sweetie.

333
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,181
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?

334
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:45,652
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

335
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,655
I'm gonna miss you.

336
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:50,555
I mean, it's the end of an era!

337
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:52,319
I know!

338
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:58,201
-Okay, bye.
-Oh, no.

339
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:01,202
So did you get the annulment?

340
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:04,467
-I couldn't.
-I knew it. Because you love Rachel.

341
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:08,246
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated--

342
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,677
Complicated because of the love.

343
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,744
I do not love Rachel.

344
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:15,953
I'm telling her
about the whole thing...

345
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:19,453
...so we can get this marriage
annulled as fast as possible.

346
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,626
Would I do that if I loved her?

347
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:24,819
I've never been more convinced
of your love for her.

348
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:29,293
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?

349
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:34,837
Oh, what's wrong?

350
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,068
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here...

351
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:41,040
...and I have to move out
and everything is changing.

352
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:44,738
Oh, my God, come here, come here.
It's okay.

353
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,247
Everything's gonna be okay.

354
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:50,545
-Thank you.
-Of course.

355
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:03,730
So Ross and Rachel got married.

356
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,727
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.

357
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,831
You think we should hook up?

358
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,171
Oh, we do.

359
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:13,878
But not just yet.

360
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:17,340
Really? Well, when?

361
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:23,321
Well, first Chandler and Monica
will get married...

362
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,783
...and be filthy rich, by the way.

363
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:27,525
But it won't work out.

364
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:29,385
I know.

365
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:33,330
Then I'll marry Chandler
for the money.

366
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,000
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.

367
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:38,567
Great.

368
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,738
But then we ditch them
and we get married.

369
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,968
We'll have Chandler's money
and Rachel's kids.

370
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:49,180
Getting custody will be easy
because of Rachel's drinking problem.

371
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:51,574
What about Ross?

372
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,911
I don't want to go
into the whole thing.

373
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:56,119
But we have words and I kill him.
