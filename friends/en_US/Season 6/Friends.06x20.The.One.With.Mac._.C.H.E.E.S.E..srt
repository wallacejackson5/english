1
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:08,819
"We've got 3 minutes till it blows.
We won't make it!"

2
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:12,014
"You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself!"

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,191
"I won't leave you."

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:19,866
"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"

5
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:25,204
-"No, you're not. Not to me."
-Oh, my God.

6
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,401
-What?
-I am extremely talented.

7
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:31,067
-Yeah. You're great.
-Yeah.

8
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,237
-Okay, let's take it from--
-No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.

9
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,079
I thought I was pretty good, too.

10
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:41,083
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

11
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,882
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

12
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:47,686
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.

13
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,761
Fine. I'll do it without you!

14
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,822
I don't need you or anybody else!

15
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:56,331
I'm gonna make it on my own!

16
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:00,802
You'll see! You'll all see!

17
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:06,003
The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

18
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:43,042
So what are you auditioning for?

19
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,512
It's a new TV show.

20
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:49,178
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac" !

21
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:54,388
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with my robot partner.

22
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,994
He's a computerized humanoid...

23
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:00,292
...electronically enhanced
secret enforcer.

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,900
Or "C.H.E.E.S.E."

25
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:08,503
-So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-That's the title!

26
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:13,778
They lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."

27
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:15,505
That is lucky.

28
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,385
So Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

29
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:21,247
...the star of your own TV show.

30
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:25,892
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,620
Don't get your hopes up.
It probably won't happen.

32
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:31,490
Why would you say that?

33
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,723
Well, I mean, come on, guys.
My own TV show?

34
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,732
-I don't know if I'm good enough.
-I am.

35
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:42,769
What are you talking about?
You're a terrific actor.

36
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:47,107
-You really think so?
-How can you even ask that question?

37
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:51,213
-She's pretty.
-Yeah. And she's really nice too.

38
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:54,512
She taught me all about
how to work with cameras...

39
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:57,451
...and "smell the fart" acting.

40
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,491
-I'm sorry. What?
-Excuse me?

41
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:05,388
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

42
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:08,567
...sometimes you need time
to remember your next one.

43
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:13,837
So while you're thinking of it, you
take this pause where you look intense.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,974
You know, like this:

45
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:19,343
Okay.

46
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,808
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

47
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:27,180
<i>Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey,</i>
<i>your sister's surgeon.</i>

48
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:30,622
<i>You sister is suffering from a....</i>

49
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:40,159
Well, Eva, we've done
some excellent work here.

50
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:46,900
And I would have to say
your problem is quite clear.

51
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:52,570
<i>All you want is a tinkle</i>

52
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,678
<i>What you envy's a schwang</i>

53
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:59,309
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

54
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:02,347
<i>Or play with or simply let hang</i>

55
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,922
I play Al Pacino's butt.

56
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,194
All right?

57
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:12,229
He goes into the shower and then,
I'm his butt.

58
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:14,900
-Oh, my God.
-Come on, you guys.

59
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,468
This is a movie and Al Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

60
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:22,540
It's terrific. You deserve this.
After years of struggling...

61
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:26,337
...you've finally cracked your way
into show business.

62
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:33,412
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,020
-No, you're right, it is.
-Yeah.

64
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,816
So, you gonna invite us
to the big opening?

65
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:43,321
All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.

66
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:48,500
<i>Good luck, good luck</i>
<i>We all wish you good luck</i>

67
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,669
Yeah, whatever.

68
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:57,500
Wow, if I could dance,
I'd be a triple threat.

69
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:04,783
It's your turn.

70
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,650
Oh, are we playing this?

71
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,480
How'd the audition go?

72
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:15,890
Terrible. I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

73
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:21,294
Wait. Are you pretending it didn't
go well, but it really did go well?

74
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,667
-Yeah, did I fool you?
-Totally!

75
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:30,304
-So it did go well?
-Amazingly well!

76
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,946
-Great!
-It's down to me and two other guys.

77
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:36,274
And they're really good.

78
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,283
One's from those allergy commercials
who's chased by flowers.

79
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,114
Oh, I love that guy!

80
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,182
What are you doing?

81
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,087
What am I doing?

82
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:52,662
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback is tomorrow at 5:00.

83
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:57,701
-I feel like my head's gonna explode.
-Well, it is overdue.

84
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:01,830
-Don't worry. You'll be fine.
-But it's so much pressure.

85
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:06,103
What you guys do is different.
I don't know if you'd understand.

86
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,081
Yeah, we don't have pressure
at our jobs.

87
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:15,243
I know what time it is, but I'm looking
at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.

88
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,817
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

89
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,052
-Is it dirty?
-Don't worry, I'll wash it.

90
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:24,388
Don't. I like it dirty.

91
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,698
That's your call.

92
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,202
So what are you going to do next?

93
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:34,873
I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.

94
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:37,339
Are they firm?

95
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,744
-They're all right.
-You sure they haven't gone bad?

96
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,544
You sure they're not very, very bad?

97
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:53,324
-No, really. They're okay.
-You gonna slice them real nice?

98
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:56,720
Actually, I was gonna
do them julienne.

99
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,629
I'm out of here.

100
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,428
I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81 -year-old woman put on a thong...

101
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,661
...and she didn't even buy it.

102
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,469
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

103
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,735
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

104
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:15,010
Bye. Call me when you
get this message.

105
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,614
Well, what happened?

106
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:20,912
Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until...

107
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:25,914
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:30,285
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>
<i>his hands weren't the problem anymore.</i>

109
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,798
-Was it?
-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

110
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,771
You ate my sandwich?

111
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:43,506
It was a mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

112
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,911
Really?

113
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,171
Now calm down.

114
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:52,512
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,081
-What?
-Well, it was quite large.

116
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:59,350
I had to throw most of it away.

117
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:03,189
You threw my sandwich away?

118
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,963
<i>My sandwich?</i>

119
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,101
<i>My sandwich!</i>

120
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,095
It's just, I want this part so much.

121
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,601
If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat
macaroni and cheese again.

122
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,371
I didn't say that. That doesn't count.

123
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:27,477
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

124
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,655
I just moved across the hall.

125
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,051
And we would have you over all the time...

126
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:35,921
...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

127
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:40,163
You're right, I could never lie to you.

128
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,765
She hates you.

129
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,470
Should I get that?

130
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:53,042
Hello? No, Joey's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

131
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:57,108
Yeah, okay. So the audition's
been moved from 5:00 to 2:30?

132
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,285
Okay, great. Bye.

133
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:12,097
-Aren't you dressed yet?
-Am I naked again?

134
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,257
We're meeting my parents
in 15 minutes.

135
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,232
I was just talking to the guys.
Look at them.

136
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,532
Is it okay if they come visit?

137
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,175
What about my allergies?

138
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:27,073
Right. Your allergies.

139
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:30,806
All her. She hates you.

140
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,695
Yes! All right.

141
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,132
How cool would it be if you could watch
a life-size version of this?

142
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:55,137
-I mean, how crazy would that be?
-As crazy as soccer?

143
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,703
Hello?

144
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:05,042
What are you talking about?
The audition's at 5.

145
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,052
Well, nobody told me.

146
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:11,851
Who'd you talk to?

147
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:17,956
Never mind.

148
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,366
You mean you didn't get it from this?

149
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:26,402
-The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.
-Maybe we can fix it.

150
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:30,335
Maybe we can send him
some big flowers and scare him!

151
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,912
How could you do this? This could've
turned my career around.

152
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,447
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

153
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:41,017
Why'd you answer my phone?

154
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:44,418
-I have a machine!
-Which I bought for you.

155
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:48,392
Taught you how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

156
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,697
If there was anything I could do,
I'd do it.

157
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:55,696
Everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

158
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,803
He could have gotten me a VCR
or golf clubs.

159
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:02,135
But no, he has to get me
the "Woman Repeller."

160
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,975
The eyesore from
the "Liberace House of Crap!"

161
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,443
-It's not that bad.
-Easy for you to say.

162
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:12,448
You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T" collection.

163
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,580
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do! I do!

164
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:18,781
I pity the fool that....

165
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,291
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I were talking and...

166
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,897
...one thing led to another and....

167
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,868
And what? Did you sleep with her?

168
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:33,903
-No! No, I just kissed her.
-What? That's even worse!

169
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,675
-How?
-I don't know! But it's the same!

170
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,274
I have no excuses.
I was over the line.

171
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:42,846
Over the line?

172
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:46,246
You're so far past the line
you can't even see it!

173
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,443
The line is a dot to you!

174
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:51,816
I'm not saying you should
magically forgive me.

175
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:55,591
But you're not perfect.
You've made errors in judgment.

176
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:56,962
Name one!

177
00:11:58,464 --> 00:11:59,954
What happened?

178
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,899
Man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

179
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:09,164
How were you locked in?
And where the hell's all of our stuff?

180
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,667
This guy came to look at the unit...

181
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:15,279
...and he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a man.

182
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,980
So you got in voluntarily?

183
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:20,482
I was trying to make a sale!

184
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,585
If I ever run into him again,
know what I'll do?

185
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,486
Bend over?

186
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:28,594
There's Lori.

187
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:33,231
Remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

188
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,300
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.

189
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:41,404
Well, well. Look what you brought.

190
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,471
And what did you bring?

191
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:47,309
She's checking her coat.

192
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:50,812
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

193
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:55,317
Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice.

194
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:00,717
Janice?

195
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:08,995
Oh, my God!

196
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,130
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

197
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:15,598
What?

198
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:19,308
No way. I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

199
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,343
You said he'd do my inseam...

200
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:25,313
...then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was....

201
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:26,678
What?

202
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:29,081
Cupping.

203
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,892
That's how they do pants!

204
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:40,956
-Isn't that how a tailor measures?
-Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

205
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,035
I said name one!

206
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:58,840
-I can't believe I did this.
-Stop beating yourself up.

207
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:02,578
People make mistakes.
These things happen.

208
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:06,819
There aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me?

209
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,717
Apparently, you're not very good at it.

210
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,027
-Do you think he'll forgive me?
-Of course.

211
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:16,633
The important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

212
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:19,600
-You know what, I kind of have.
-Already?

213
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,332
That was pretty bad what you did.

214
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,440
He will forgive you.

215
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:29,138
I like to bring a pad with me when
I answer the phone, okay?

216
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:33,614
-You didn't see how mad he was.
-I'm sure he'll forgive you.

217
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,745
We've all been there. You fight,
you make up. That's how it works.

218
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,858
It took two people to break up
this relationship!

219
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,084
Yeah! You and that copy girl...

220
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,264
...which yesterday you took
responsibility for!

221
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:49,434
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for.

222
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:51,830
-I didn't finish the letter.
-What?

223
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:55,166
-I fell asleep.
-You fell asleep?

224
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:59,136
It was 5:30 in the morning.

225
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:03,941
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

226
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,178
Front and back!

227
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:14,257
And by the way?
Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."

228
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,688
Y-O-U-R means "your."

229
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:20,164
I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

230
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,061
We are so over!

231
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,233
Fine by me!

232
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,236
And just so you know,
it's not that common...

233
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:34,311
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

234
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:36,771
I knew it!

235
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:41,317
-You had no right to go out with him.
-That's ridiculous--

236
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,780
-You sold me out!
-I did not!

237
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:47,583
-You did! You sold me--
-Would you let me talk?

238
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,757
Did you just flick me?

239
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,666
Well, you wouldn't let me finish and--

240
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,566
Stop it!

241
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,266
-Stop.
-Stop.

242
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:03,636
-All right. No, let's not do this.
-No!

243
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,803
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

244
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,073
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

245
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,513
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

246
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:25,964
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

247
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,399
-Fine.
-Fine.

248
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,069
There we go.

249
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:37,075
You know what? If we were in prison,
you guys would be my bitches.

250
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,111
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

251
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:51,812
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearing everything you own.

252
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,022
Oh, my God!

253
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,688
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

254
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,231
Maybe if I wasn't going commando.

255
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:12,167
I tell you, it's hot with all this on.
I'd better not do any lunges.

256
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:05,789
Joey?

257
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:10,561
Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!

258
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,799
Hello? Damn it!

259
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,068
Hello?

260
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:24,540
No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

261
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:29,079
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

262
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:33,783
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

263
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,085
That's great.
I'll give Joey the message.

264
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:38,796
Yes!

265
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:40,721
Okay.

266
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,564
Mac...

267
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:44,930
...audition...

268
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,739
...at 2:00.

269
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,406
Allergy...

270
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,204
...actor...

271
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,937
...attacked.

272
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,285
By dog...

273
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,054
...not...

274
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,914
...flowers.

275
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,001
-Tell me you got the message.
-What message?

276
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:21,765
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.
They needed you at 2.

277
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,135
What? It's 6:00!

278
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:26,743
Look! I wrote it on the board!

279
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:29,608
I wrote it down,
then went looking for you!

280
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,646
I went to Ross's, the coffee house....

281
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:34,649
I went to any place
they make sandwiches!

282
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:38,156
-I can't believe this, Chandler!
-I'm sorry.

283
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:43,851
-I don't know what to say!
-You might say congratulations!

284
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,827
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

285
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,167
Was that funny? I was worried.

286
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,633
-I'm sorry.
-That fake-out thing is just mean.

287
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,298
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

288
00:19:58,511 --> 00:19:59,842
Well, that's good.

289
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:03,811
Because you didn't!
And I'm incredibly happy for you!

290
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,348
That's mean!

291
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:09,777
-You had me going!
-We could do this all day.

292
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,820
Yeah, you're right.

293
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,951
Let's talk about what a huge star
I'm gonna be.

294
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,355
You're gonna be huge!
I'm gonna hug you!

295
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,427
-You hug me!
-All right.

296
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:51,260
-Do we do this too much?
-I think so.

297
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:53,431
-Yeah. Get off me.
-Yeah.

298
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,508
"C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

299
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,906
Route your backup power source
through your CPU."

300
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:11,515
"I can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you!"

301
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,821
"Then I'll carry you!"

302
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:20,114
"That'll be a neat trick...

303
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,685
" ...when you're dead!"

304
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,520
You don't have to yell.

305
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,860
There was just an explosion.
My hearing would be impaired.

306
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,631
I thought you were great.

307
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,535
For a minute, I was like,
"Where'd Ross go?"

308
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:41,638
Thank you. And that first scene
where you meet Mac....

309
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:43,747
-Yeah?
-Oh, my God. I mean....

310
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:45,242
And you know what?

311
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:48,887
That's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

312
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,653
-Holding us back.
-Totally.
