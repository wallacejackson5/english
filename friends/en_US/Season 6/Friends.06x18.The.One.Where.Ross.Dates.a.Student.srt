1
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:08,212
I got my teacher evaluations.
Look what this student wrote.

2
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:12,722
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

3
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:18,054
You are definitely the hottie
of the Paleontology Department."

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:23,765
"Hotties of Paleontology."
There's a big-selling calendar.

5
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:29,002
-Who wrote it?
-The evaluations are all anonymous.

6
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,268
-You have their exams?
-Yeah.

7
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:35,812
You could just match the handwriting
and there's your admirer.

8
00:00:37,718 --> 00:00:40,380
A hot girl's at stake
and he's Rain Man.

9
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:46,148
Wait a minute. Why are we
so sure that this is a girl?

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,861
It's a girl!

11
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,427
But it wouldn't matter.

12
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:58,034
Because I'm a teacher.
She's a student.

13
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,604
-It's illegal?
-It's frowned upon.

14
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:04,002
-And there's a big age gap.
-When you're 90--

15
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:08,611
I know, she'll be 80 and it won't
seem like such a big difference.

16
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,608
That's not what I was gonna say.

17
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:19,156
When you're 90, you'll still have the
memory of being with a 20-year-old.

18
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:23,655
The One Where Ross Dates A Student

19
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:02,729
-Monica...?
-I don't know.

20
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:07,562
You know your college friend
who became a movie director?

21
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:11,300
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

22
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:17,008
-What's a movement class?
-He's pretending he didn't take mime.

23
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:22,485
She's directing a new Al Pacino movie.
You gotta get me an audition.

24
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,953
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

25
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:28,059
Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

26
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:31,422
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3000--

27
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:35,361
Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing
the subject? What?

28
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,502
-Will you make the call?
-Okay, I'll try.

29
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:43,903
Thanks. Last auditions are Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

30
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,874
Remember Thursday.
Remember Thursday?

31
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,640
Yeah, so Tuesday?

32
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:52,947
Thursday!

33
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:58,055
Just think of it like this:
The third day. Monday, one day.

34
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,258
Tuesday, two day.

35
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:02,618
Wednesday....
When day, what day?

36
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:04,023
Thursday!

37
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,855
The third day, okay?

38
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,624
-Thank you.
-Okay.

39
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,303
-Hey, Monica--?
-She doesn't know.

40
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:19,770
-I'm gonna check my messages.
-You thought of that in there?

41
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,813
Nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

42
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,516
Hello?

43
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:29,715
Rachel.

44
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:32,255
Someone's in our apartment.
Call the cops!

45
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,026
You're on the phone!

46
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,586
-Oh, my God!
-What?

47
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,298
Oh, my God! Thank you!

48
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,729
There was a fire at our place.

49
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:46,395
-Oh, my God! How bad was it?
-It was a fire, I'm guessing not good.

50
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,441
-Come on, we gotta go!
-Yeah, come on.

51
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,075
What are you smiling about?

52
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:59,883
The part I want to audition for is
a fireman. This is so meant to be!

53
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:11,727
You were very generous
with your grades this semester.

54
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,662
-Professor Geller?
-Yeah?

55
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,007
-I really enjoyed your class.
-Oh, thank you. Thanks very much.

56
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,641
I'm a little embarrassed about
calling you a hottie.

57
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,979
-That was you?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:38,089
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

59
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,323
Want to go out sometime?

60
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,326
That's not the best idea.

61
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:48,490
Oh, because I was thinking,
the semester's over.

62
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:52,364
-You're not my teacher anymore.
-What time?

63
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,002
Oh, you know what? Forget it.

64
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,677
I see you already gave me an A.

65
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:02,310
-Gotcha.
-I'm kidding! God!

66
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,615
So seriously, what time?

67
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,123
Coming through. Coming through.
Oh! Hello. Hi.

68
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:16,659
Right. Coming through!

69
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,959
Okay. It's not so bad.

70
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,464
Most of the damage
was contained to the bedrooms.

71
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,605
Hey, buddy, think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

72
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:29,741
-Excuse me?
-Joey! He's working.

73
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,404
You would look good in that.

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,375
Oh, how bad is it?

75
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:37,049
It's really bad.

76
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,244
The only thing that isn't burned is an
ax, which I do not remember buying.

77
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,388
-How's your room?
-Everything's ruined.

78
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:48,060
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite sweater.

79
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,955
Isn't that mine?

80
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,755
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

81
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,728
You won't be able to live here for
a while. You have a place to stay?

82
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,269
Oh! Wow!

83
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,340
Okay, look, pal...

84
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,836
...I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

85
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:11,347
But if you give me your number,
I'll call you sometime.

86
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,711
Yes, they can stay with us.

87
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:18,288
Do you know what
started the fire, Mr. Fireman?

88
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,050
Well, do either of you smoke?

89
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:24,627
No. But yeah,
I could use one now. Thanks.

90
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:29,561
-Do you light candles, burn incense?
-I do all the time. I love them!

91
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:35,101
Oh, my God, I did it! It's me,
it's me! I burned down the house!

92
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:39,608
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

93
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:42,143
I warned her about those candles.

94
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:49,414
I can't believe how long it's been.

95
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,556
Hey, Chandler, is that...?

96
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:57,463
-Oh, that's great, good for you.
-So, is it...?

97
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,569
Okay. So, yeah, maybe
we can get together....

98
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:10,408
Hold on for one second.

99
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,838
What?

100
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:15,310
Do you want to get a pizza later?

101
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,181
Hi, I'm back.

102
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:21,545
Yeah, that sounds great.
We'll do it then. Okay, bye.

103
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,585
When's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

104
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,894
Hi. We didn't get to it.

105
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,566
I'm taking her to coffee.
We'll do it then.

106
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,495
Now you're going on a date
with this girl?

107
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,729
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

108
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:43,203
You can't just call up
and ask somebody for a favor.

109
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:46,276
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

110
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:47,707
Right, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:51,415
-It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
-We only went out once.

112
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,276
You dated her?!

113
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,047
Not once.

114
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:01,756
Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

115
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:05,226
You want to do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

116
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:17,040
That's great. My friend Joey's
in the movie business.

117
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,077
You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,671
My friend's name is Joey.

119
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,615
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

120
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:29,946
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me
if he can edit my new movie.

121
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,555
Can you believe that?

122
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,591
You know, I haven't spoken to him
in 10 years...

123
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,456
...and he asks me for a favor?

124
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,297
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

125
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,468
No "How you doing?"

126
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:48,798
Man, I mean, not even
a cup of coffee first.

127
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,839
-The nerve.
-Yeah.

128
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,408
Refill?

129
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,513
This is last-minute, so I want
to apologize for the mess.

130
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,308
Oh, who cares?

131
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:06,088
Oh, my God! It sure didn't look
this way when I lived here.

132
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:07,691
I know!

133
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:13,963
But there's only room for one, so one
of you will have to stay at Joey's.

134
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:19,228
Since the fire was kind of my fault,
you should get to stay here.

135
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:23,464
Hey, hey, now. This was no one's
fault. It was an accident.

136
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:26,177
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

137
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,004
Okay!

138
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:31,241
You're the first guest
at "Hotel Monica."

139
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:32,508
Hotel Monica!

140
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,776
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

141
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:37,422
I thought I'd bring them
to you in bed.

142
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,990
-You've been through so much.
-I have.

143
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,697
This right here is where
I keep the pizza.

144
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,192
And that's where the napkin is.

145
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:52,400
-What's that smell?
-I know! I don't....

146
00:09:55,808 --> 00:10:00,302
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

147
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:04,813
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson."

148
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,040
Who?

149
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,221
Oh. I had trouble remembering names,
so I came up with nicknames.

150
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,483
The guy on the other side of you
was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt."

151
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,824
Oh, yeah.

152
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:22,634
-So did you have a nickname for me?
-No. No.

153
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,893
Yes, you did. What was it?

154
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:29,272
"Cutie McPretty."

155
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:32,443
Oh, that's so sweet!

156
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,840
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

157
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,952
You said it might be weird,
the whole student/teacher thing?

158
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:43,952
And to be frank,
I thought it would be too.

159
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,487
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.

160
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:52,528
-Dr. Geller!
-Burt!

161
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,799
-Did you sleep well last night?
-I did.

162
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:02,441
Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

163
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,907
Know what Joey left on my pillow?

164
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:06,271
Gum.

165
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:12,277
-We determined the cause of the fire.
-I know. It was my candle, my candle!

166
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:17,278
No, there was an appliance left on.
It looks like a curling iron.

167
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:19,957
-I don't use a curling iron.
-Someone does.

168
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:24,089
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

169
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:27,931
-It could've been a hair straightener.
-Oh.

170
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,296
This is where I keep the pizza.

171
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,640
And--
Hey, where'd the napkin go?

172
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:39,435
What is that?

173
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,114
Is that old shrimp?

174
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,484
I think it is!

175
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,017
I wouldn't want my best guest
to strain her eyes.

176
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,057
Thanks, Monica.

177
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,598
-Does that smell bother you?
-From Joey's?

178
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,632
I can hardly smell it over here.

179
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:07,837
Well, you let me know if you can.
I can bake a pie to cover it.

180
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,806
-I can smell it a little, bake a pie.
-Okay.

181
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:17,209
Hello?

182
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,283
One minute, please.
It's the fire inspector.

183
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:24,046
Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

184
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:25,646
Really?

185
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:29,760
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't
the hair straightener...

186
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:31,691
...that started the fire.

187
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:34,329
No, no. It was the candles.

188
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:37,901
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

189
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:42,767
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is...

190
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,274
...okay, well I have to go now.

191
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,253
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

192
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:01,289
I thought the age difference might be
a problem, but it wasn't.

193
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,825
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

194
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,503
A concept lost on some people.

195
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,329
It's okay to date a student?

196
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,441
Well, not really. Technically,
it's not against the rules.

197
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:21,670
But it's frowned upon, especially by
the professor we saw last night:

198
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,882
"Judgy Von Holier-than-thou."

199
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:31,880
You don't want to get a reputation
as "Professor McNails-his-students."

200
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:38,230
-Yeah. What should I do?
-Well, it seems pretty clear.

201
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:41,727
What's more important?
What people think or how you feel?

202
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:45,437
-You gotta follow your heart.
-Joey, that's so sweet.

203
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,143
-Hi.
-Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?

204
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:57,009
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open? Say, Thursday?

205
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,611
-I couldn't do it.
-You couldn't do it?

206
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,287
I need more time.
We're going to dinner.

207
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,286
You're going out with her again?

208
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,185
-Going out with who?
-Dana Keystone, from college.

209
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:12,090
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she...?

210
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:15,331
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

211
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:16,899
Oh.

212
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,164
-Joey, you didn't even know her!
-Yeah, whatever.

213
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,139
Great story again.

214
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:31,281
The yarns that you weave!

215
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:35,285
You know, actually, I should get going.

216
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:39,481
Oh, no, no, stay!
Because you should stay.

217
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,495
Oh, I am really flattered.

218
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:50,135
But I just....
I don't feel that way about you.

219
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:52,796
Oh, no, no. That's not--

220
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:56,634
I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know, you're such a sweet guy...

221
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:59,003
...and I don't want to hurt you.

222
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:02,306
I wish I could do something
to make you feel better.

223
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,608
No-- Really?

224
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:06,413
Of course.

225
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,615
Well, it just hurts so bad, I....

226
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

227
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:17,285
-Maybe there is one thing you can do.
-What? Anything. Anything.

228
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:21,331
Well, I mean, this is just
off the top of my head now.

229
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,295
But I have this friend--
This actor friend.

230
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:28,632
He would kill me if he knew
that I was doing this.

231
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,467
But...

232
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:37,075
...would it be possible for him to
audition for your movie on Thursday?

233
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:39,684
Absolutely.

234
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,147
But...

235
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:46,324
...you'd really feel better if your
friend could audition for my movie?

236
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,686
The heart wants what it wants. Bye.

237
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,436
Hey! How's it going?

238
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,732
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

239
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,005
Yes, it has. I made cookies!

240
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,179
I'm still full from your
homemade potato chips.

241
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:12,506
But you should eat them now,
because they're hot from the oven.

242
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:13,874
Okay.

243
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:18,580
But not in here! Can't eat them
in bed, remember? No crumbies!

244
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:22,021
Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second.

245
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,250
Okay.

246
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,599
-What are you doing?
-This doesn't lock, does it?

247
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:45,208
-Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.
-It's all right, don't worry about it.

248
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,885
But look!
That's gonna leave a stain.

249
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,647
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

250
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,956
-Really?
-Yeah, look.

251
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,389
Yeah.

252
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,696
-I've never lived like this before.
-I know.

253
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,540
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

254
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,544
What do you want to do now?
Want to get a drink?

255
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:20,774
I can't.

256
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:25,582
-Oh, you have some studying to do?
-No, I have some turning 21 to do.

257
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,329
You know, I remember when I was
in college, we used to--

258
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:38,136
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.

259
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,934
Do you not want to be seen with me?

260
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:46,610
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

261
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,941
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

262
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:53,777
What? No, no, wait, wait--

263
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:57,789
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

264
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,025
I mean, we like each other, right?

265
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,159
There's nothing wrong with that.

266
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,118
Come on.

267
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:11,268
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

268
00:18:12,938 --> 00:18:14,872
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi.

269
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,541
Aren't you in my popular culture
class?

270
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,244
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth is a student.

271
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,175
And we're dating.

272
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:25,508
And you may frown upon that but...

273
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:28,152
...we're not gonna hide it anymore.

274
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,889
You are so fired.

275
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,326
-What?
-They'll fire you.

276
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:38,052
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.

277
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,890
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

278
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,406
I love it at Joey's!

279
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,576
-Nice!
-Thanks.

280
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,110
So you busy Thursday?

281
00:18:55,581 --> 00:19:00,280
Oh, very funny. Remember?
My audition was supposed to be Thursday.

282
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:06,825
You got me the audition?
Let's hug it up!

283
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,291
Okay, okay! What are you
gonna do to me if you get the part?

284
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,659
-Hey.
-Hi.

285
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,392
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.

286
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,935
I know they said the hair straightener
started the fire.

287
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,198
But I think I'm partly at fault.

288
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,934
You see, I didn't tell you, but...

289
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,874
...I had recently refilled
the tissues.

290
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,776
And so, let's face it,
that's just kindling.

291
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:35,053
So I think it's fair that
I stay at Joey's.

292
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:38,018
No, no, no, this was my fault.

293
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:40,691
-Besides, I'm fine here.
-Okay.

294
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,856
-Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
-Really?

295
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:48,463
-She said something about crumbies.
-No, no, no! I was so careful.

296
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:53,467
You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

297
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:57,631
That's right. All the ladies
want to stay at Joey's.

298
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,245
No, I don't want to switch.

299
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:04,142
Please! I can throw
wet paper towels here!

300
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,842
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

301
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:12,090
I know. I'm sorry.

302
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,316
All right, fine.

303
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:19,524
This looks like so much fun.
God, what a mess.

304
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:28,630
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

305
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:33,141
I can't date you or have
a hot plate in my office.

306
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:38,539
I can't believe we have
to stop seeing each other.

307
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:43,381
For what it's worth, I did appreciate
you standing up for me.

308
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:46,484
That felt really nice.

309
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,251
Kind of made me like you even more.

310
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:53,726
I know, I know. I really like
you too. But we can't date.

311
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,366
It's against the rules.
It's forbidden.

312
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,769
-Wow.
-What?

313
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:03,567
Just hearing you describe it
as "forbidden" ...

314
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,401
...it's really hot.

315
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:08,744
Really?

316
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,081
Yeah.

317
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:16,512
Well, I don't care how hot it is,
it's wrong.

318
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:21,886
-Stop it.
-No, no. It's wrong.

319
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,828
It's naughty.

320
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,256
It's...

321
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,598
...taboo.

322
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:30,959
Shut the book.

323
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:35,903
Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.

324
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:41,602
Hey.

325
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,039
Hey.

326
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:45,978
-So?
-So...?

327
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,281
It's Thursday!
How was the audition?

328
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:52,719
It's-- Monday, one day. Tuesday,
two day. Wednesday, what day--

329
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,161
Oh!
