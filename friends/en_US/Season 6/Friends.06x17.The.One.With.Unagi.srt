1
00:00:06,553 --> 00:00:09,215
Remember when I had a monkey?

2
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,652
What was I thinking?

3
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:17,989
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent
tip? Did I do something wrong?

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,467
20 percent is a pretty generous tip.

5
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:23,795
You know what's more generous?
50 percent!

6
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:29,199
-You know what's even more generous?
-I see where you're going.

7
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:31,376
What's up with the greed?

8
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:33,009
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,774
I have to get new headshots made,
and they're really expensive.

10
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:39,645
I'm down to, like, three.

11
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:43,952
Actually, two, because one of them
I blackened some teeth.

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,886
Why'd I do that?

13
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:49,785
Isn't there something you can do
to earn extra money?

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,897
Can't you pick up an extra shift here?

15
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:56,293
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.

16
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,402
It helps if you've got
a little of this going on.

17
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:03,805
Wow! I still have it.

18
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:08,212
Don't you have an audition today?
Maybe you'll get that job.

19
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:12,778
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,887
I used to get medical experiments
done on me.

21
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:19,014
Finally, an explanation.

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,223
I used to get paid for
all kinds of medical stuff.

23
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:27,695
Let's see.... Well, I don't want
to donate sperm again.

24
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,526
I really prefer doing that
at the home office.

25
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:35,040
Maybe they want some of my blood
or spit or something, huh?

26
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,634
-Joey?
-Yeah.

27
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:40,279
What did I tell you
about talking while working?

28
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,572
Do it?

29
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:47,846
That guy's been waiting 10 minutes.
He's complained about you three times.

30
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:51,585
Now, where was I?

31
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:56,186
The One With Unagi

32
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,160
What are you up to?

33
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,493
We went to a self-defense class today.

34
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,433
Kicking a guy in the crotch all
morning really takes it out of you.

35
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:42,738
Takes it out of you?

36
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:46,742
Now we can kick anybody's ass.

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,210
After one class?
I don't think so.

38
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:52,047
You want to see me self-defend myself?

39
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:54,253
Pretend you're a predator.

40
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:55,648
Go on, I dare you!

41
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:01,092
Of course you can defend yourself from
an attack you know is coming.

42
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,057
That's not enough.

43
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:06,494
Look, I studied karate
for a long time.

44
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:10,901
And there's a concept you
should be familiar with.

45
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:15,369
It's what the Japanese call <i>unagi.</i>

46
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:19,108
Isn't that a kind of sushi?

47
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:21,305
No, it's a concept.

48
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,414
Yeah, it is.
It's freshwater eel.

49
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:26,484
Maybe it means that too.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,814
I would kill for
a salmon-skin roll right now.

51
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,184
Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.

52
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:38,227
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.

53
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:45,267
<i>Unagi</i> is a state of total awareness.

54
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,265
Only by achieving true <i>unagi...</i>

55
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:52,774
...can you be prepared for any danger
that may befall you.

56
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:56,480
In case someone's trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...

57
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,581
...or your kettle of fish?

58
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,883
It's one thing being prepared
for an attack against each other.

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,893
Whole other story being prepared for
an attack. I don't know-- Surprise!

60
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,240
You knew that was coming...

61
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,477
...but that doesn't mean
you have <i>unagi.</i>

62
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:32,784
If we made reservations, we could have
<i>unagi</i> in a half-hour.

63
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,547
-Is Monica here?
-No.

64
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:41,215
I need help. I don't know
what to get for Valentine's Day.

65
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:46,228
Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
so I wouldn't get her a calendar.

66
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:50,495
She was working,
so we're celebrating tonight.

67
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,866
Why don't you book a day for
both of you at those romantic spas?

68
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:57,440
That's actually a good idea.

69
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:00,509
And, of course, crotchless panties.

70
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,944
As appealing as that sounds
to her boyfriend...

71
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,216
...and her brother....

72
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,458
We promised to make
each other gifts this year.

73
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:15,992
-I love that.
-You guys!

74
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,557
You can't make crotchless panties?

75
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:21,994
You take scissors and cut--

76
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:23,257
Okay, okay, okay.

77
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,572
Making things sounds so much fun.

78
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,034
I thought so too, until I papier-mâchéd
one of my eyes shut.

79
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:32,942
I love papier-mâché!
What did you make?

80
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:35,044
I made a flar-lar-lar.

81
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,181
-What is that?
-Nothing!

82
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:41,815
So, what are you gonna do?

83
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:44,786
Have you made anything
I can take credit for?

84
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:48,517
I have, I have! I started making
little sock bunnies!

85
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,662
Oh, for crying out loud!

86
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,030
Wait a minute. That is my sock!

87
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,400
Now it's your little bunny friend.

88
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:10,343
Okay....

89
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:17,623
This actually is a flar-lar-lar.

90
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,256
Can I ask about the
Valentine's Day gifts?

91
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,989
-Yeah.
-Do we have to make the entire thing?

92
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,828
Yes. Did you forget to make yours?

93
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:32,804
Of course not.

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,999
I just have to go to the place
where I made it and pick it up.

95
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:42,448
I can't wait. It'll be
the best Valentine's Day ever!

96
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,782
I can't believe it!
Make the presents!

97
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:52,391
-What?
-Just so excited to make the presents!

98
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,859
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.

99
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:06,001
With all due respect,
I'd like to donate some fluids.

100
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,401
We're at the end of a research cycle
and not looking for applicants now.

101
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,274
That's too bad. I've been saving up.

102
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,253
You sure there's no studies
I can participate in?

103
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,619
-Here's a schedule.
-Thanks.

104
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,090
This one starts now.

105
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:32,454
Only identical twins are eligible.
It's a twin study.

106
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:34,299
But it's $2000!

107
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,568
Sorry.

108
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:39,794
And this?

109
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:45,266
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani
on Attractive Nurse Receptionist."

110
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:50,147
Results are back on that one.
They're not good.

111
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,418
-That was good.
-Yeah.

112
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,023
Danger! Danger!

113
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,390
What the hell was that?

114
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:09,098
A lesson in the importance of <i>unagi.</i>

115
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:13,928
You're a freak!

116
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,234
Perhaps.

117
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,035
Now I'm curious.

118
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:24,309
At what point during those girlish
screams would you have kicked my ass?

119
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,516
All right, so we weren't prepared!

120
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,756
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic
measures to make my point.

121
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:36,825
I just want you to be safe.

122
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:39,860
Danger!

123
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:45,902
Ah-ha!

124
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,763
<i>Unagi</i>!

125
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,811
<i>2000 bucks is a lot of money.</i>

126
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,683
<i>I wish I had a twin.</i>

127
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,253
<i>Where could I find someone...</i>

128
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:05,151
<i>...who looks exactly like me?</i>

129
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:28,571
Chandler.

130
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,582
I sensed it was you.

131
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:35,818
What?

132
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,053
<i>Unagi.</i>

133
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,650
I'm always aware.

134
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,852
Are you aware that <i>unagi</i> is an eel?

135
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,494
-What's up?
-I can't figure out what to make Monica.

136
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:51,101
Why don't you make her
one of your little jokes?

137
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:55,273
I'm going crazy.
Do you have anything homemade?

138
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,642
You know what?
She'd love this.

139
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:02,370
It's a replica of <i>Apollo 8.</i>
I made it in the sixth grade.

140
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:07,876
I could use that. I could say,
"Your love sends me to the moon."

141
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,988
Except <i>Apollo 8</i> didn't
actually land on the moon.

142
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:16,287
You can say, "Your love lets me orbit
the moon twice and return safely."

143
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,056
I can't give this to her.

144
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,269
-Why not?
-It says "Captain Ross" on the side.

145
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,140
And it says "I hate Monica"
on the bottom.

146
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:33,609
Danger!

147
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,116
Salmon-skin roll.

148
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,774
Yes, honey, I made it myself.

149
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,985
I can't do it. I can't do it.

150
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,862
A mixed tape! A mixed tape!

151
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:34,165
Hi! Ready to exchange gifts?

152
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:37,399
-Sure. You go first.
-Okay, come here.

153
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,444
Okay, it's not wrapped
because I just finished it.

154
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:46,014
But I made you a tape of what I think
are all romantic songs.

155
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:49,378
What a great gift!

156
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,459
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?

157
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,121
We'll have to listen and see.

158
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,728
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.

159
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,361
You ready to open yours?

160
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,280
It's a sock bunny.

161
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,188
Remember how I call you bunny?

162
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,522
Not really.

163
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:30,189
I did one time.
And I want to start doing it more.

164
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:33,529
-That's what this is about.
-I see.

165
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,098
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.

166
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,930
No, she doesn't.
What she makes, they're sock rabbits.

167
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,767
They're completely different.
Okay, okay.

168
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:44,803
I didn't make it!

169
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:48,811
I forgot about tonight and that we're
supposed to make the presents.

170
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,308
It's okay.

171
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,842
No, it's not okay.

172
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,743
You're so incredible.

173
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,854
You went through all this time
and effort to make this tape.

174
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:01,926
I'll make this up to you.
I will.

175
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:06,621
I am going to cook you
anything you want in here.

176
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:11,131
And I'm going to do anything
you want in there.

177
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,402
Well, I did put a lot of thought
into the tape.

178
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,417
You are way too young
to have seen that.

179
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,054
Your birthday's in a month and a half.

180
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,830
What if I forget to get you
a present for that too?

181
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:42,864
You are totally and completely
100 percent forgiven.

182
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,635
We've got to wash that.

183
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:53,775
Remember that jacket you loved
that was too expensive?

184
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,037
You have done enough.

185
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,747
I'll wake up early and get it.

186
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,112
No, you don't--
Get it in black, not brown.

187
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,414
Your cake is ready.

188
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:13,331
It's like that old saying,
"Have sex, eat some cake."

189
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,100
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.

190
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,868
Who the hell are you?

191
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,141
I'm Joey.

192
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:31,207
How are you doing?

193
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:35,449
No! No! No! No! No!

194
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,446
How you doing?

195
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,754
How you doing?
Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall.

196
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,667
I've got to apologize
on behalf of Carl.

197
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,929
Who the hell is Carl?

198
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:54,968
Did I not mention?

199
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:01,340
Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin
for a medical research project.

200
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:08,220
Sometimes the good ideas are
right in front of you.

201
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:13,558
It sounds crazy, but it might work.
The only problem is Carl's acting....

202
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,624
The only problem?

203
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:20,630
He's the reason I didn't get that big
commercial a couple of years ago.

204
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:23,096
We were supposed to be brothers,
but he messed up.

205
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,461
Can I get a piece of that cake?

206
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:29,669
Pizza! We like pizza!
Get out!

207
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,847
-Pat Sajak?
-Yep.

208
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,053
-Alex Trebek?
-Of course.

209
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:44,654
-Chuck Woolery?
-Definitely.

210
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:49,885
You will not find a single game-show
host whose ass I cannot kick.

211
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,736
-Say it!
-Say we are <i>unagi</i>!

212
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,337
It's not something you are,
it's something you have.

213
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,370
Say it!

214
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,309
I could easily get out of this...

215
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:14,451
...but there's a chance
you could get very, very hurt!

216
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:31,402
Carl, we're next. Now remember,
what is this not gonna be?

217
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:34,538
-Another Minute Maid fiasco.
-That's right.

218
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,072
And what are you not gonna do?

219
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:39,905
-I'm not gonna talk because--
-Damn it, Carl!

220
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,181
Can I have the next one, please?

221
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:47,680
Thank you.

222
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,917
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.

223
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,618
That's us.

224
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:55,190
But this is a study
for identical twins.

225
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,295
That's right. $2000.

226
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,262
But you're not identical twins.

227
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,698
Damn it, Carl!

228
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,269
Oh, my good God.

229
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:20,283
Continuing the countdown of your
favorite meals.

230
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,452
Tonight, number three:

231
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:27,221
Macaroni and cheese
with cut-up hot dogs.

232
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:32,527
Look, you have done enough.
You have to stop this now.

233
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,756
I will, but not tonight.

234
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,096
For dinner music, I thought we could
listen to that tape that you made me.

235
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:41,096
Oh, the mixed tape.

236
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:52,517
"The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.

237
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,013
Dance with me.

238
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:15,738
You are just the sweetest.

239
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:23,074
<i>I love the way you look every night,</i>
<i>Chandler.</i>

240
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,978
<i>That's why I made you this tape.</i>

241
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:34,488
<i>Happy birthday!</i>
<i>Love, Janice!</i>

242
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:41,859
No, you're the sweetest.

243
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,002
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class.

244
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,802
Remember, be safe out there.

245
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:01,549
-Great class.
-Thanks.

246
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,618
I was watching.

247
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,785
A couple of questions:

248
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,690
You know that last move...

249
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:15,092
...where that woman tripped you
and pinned you to the floor?

250
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,629
What would you do next?

251
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:19,302
She'd take the keys
and jam them in your--

252
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:22,507
No, no. What would you do next?

253
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:25,675
-Who, me, the attacker?
-Yes, that's right.

254
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:27,868
Why?

255
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,572
I tried attacking two women.
Did not work.

256
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:32,908
What?

257
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:35,382
No, it's okay.
They're my friends.

258
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,987
In fact, I was married to one of them.

259
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,493
You attacked your ex-wife?

260
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:44,560
Oh, no. No, no.

261
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,458
I tried.

262
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:51,662
But I couldn't.
That's why I'm here.

263
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:54,495
Maybe we could attack them together!

264
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:58,501
That's a no.

265
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,742
I am so, so, so, so sorry.

266
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,520
And I will cook
anything you want in here...

267
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:15,284
...and do anything you want in there.

268
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:19,855
Yeah, you will!
And are you kidding me?

269
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,299
Come on, Monica,
it's our Valentine's Day.

270
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,596
Please, please, please, please?

271
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:30,976
Okay.

272
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:50,323
-So are we going in there?
-I am!

273
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,412
Nowhere to run.

274
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,378
I don't like sitting up here.
I'm gonna go over--

275
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,109
No, they got here first.

276
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,792
-Why is Ross doing that?
-Danger!

277
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:30,559
Oh, my God!
Why is he jumping on those women?

278
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:34,128
We should help them.

279
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,500
I don't think they need any help.
