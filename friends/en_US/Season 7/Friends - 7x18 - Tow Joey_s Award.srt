00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:05,403  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Guys, you won't believe this!

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,365  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I just talked to my agent...
- Oh, my God!

3
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,647  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.

4
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,641  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:523
I got nominated for
<i>Days of Our Lives</i>!

5
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:18,561  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Good for you!
- Congratulations!

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,522  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe you're nominated
for an Emmy!

7
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:25,921  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
- <i>Soap Opera Digest</i> Award?
- No. I'm up for a "Soapie. "

8
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,087  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is that something you're making up?

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,611  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:523
No, no, no, it's real!
And it has been, since 1998.

10
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,085  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm up for a Soapie!

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,202  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:44,968  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
My God! That's the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!

13
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:48,921  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:523
Thank you! I guess we know
who I'll take to the awards!

14
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:52,209  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
Don't kid about that!
Will all the stars be there?

15
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:54,528  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
Many are scheduled to appear.

16
00:00:56,532 --> 00:01:00,161  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I can't go. I'll be too nervous!
- I'll go.

17
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,125  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're getting married.
This is all I have.

18
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,842  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
The One With Joey's Award

00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:47,123  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:054 Y2:132
Ernest Muhlbrat hypothesized that the
velociraptor, when threatened...

21
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:51,411  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:054 Y2:132
...would expand its collar and
emit a high-pitched noise...

22
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,443  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:094
...to frighten off predators.

23
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:54,881  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr. Lewis?

24
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,285  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
What kind of noise?

25
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,891  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:054 Y2:132
Just a high-pitched,
intimidating noise.

26
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,680  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
But like how?

27
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,326  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:054 Y2:092
Well, we don't know for sure.

28
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:11,841  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:054 Y2:132
But in my head,
it sounded something like this:

29
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:27,725  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:054 Y2:094
Of course, this is just conjecture.

30
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:32,408  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:095
Okay. That's all for today.

31
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:36,730  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Mr. Morse,
can I see you for a moment?

32
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,481  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:054 Y2:091
Yes, sir?

33
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:44,521  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:054 Y2:132
I need to talk to you
about your midterm exam.

34
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:48,921  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:133
- I'm afraid I had to fail you.
- Why?

35
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:52,007  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:054 Y2:094
Well, you need 60% to pass.

36
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:54,123  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:523
- What did I get?
- Seven.

37
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,329  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:054 Y2:095
That's not so good.

38
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,285  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:054 Y2:133
No, no, it's not.
What happened, Ned?

39
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:06,323  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:054 Y2:127
Maybe you can cut me some slack.
I'm sort of in love.

40
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,284  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm sorry, but that's
really not my problem.

41
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,530  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm in love with you.

42
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,126  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
That brings me in the loop a little.

43
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:22,130  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

44
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:25,603  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:523
When you're up there
and you're teaching...

45
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:28,042  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and your face gets all serious... .

46
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,888  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
You look so good. When you wear that
tight little turtleneck sweater...

47
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:39,931  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

48
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:41,651  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:486 Y2:523
You're a student.

49
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:43,683  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I like women.

50
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:47,931  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:523
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of these chairs.

51
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,483  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:523
That guy at the counter's
totally checking you out.

52
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:56,488  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

53
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:01,208  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Oh, my God, he's really cute!
- Go for it.

54
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,771  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, I'm engaged.

55
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:06,486  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm saying, get his number,
just in case.

56
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,971  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
But if Chandler's in an accident
and can't perform sexually...

57
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:16,967  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
...he'd want you to take a lover to
satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill.

58
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,928  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can I just tell you something?

59
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:26,891  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged.

60
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,523  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is kind of embarrassing.

61
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:33,610  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
I actually came over
to talk to your friend.

62
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,050  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:523
You should be embarrassed.

63
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:45,929  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I thought you knew I looked at you.
- I did, but that was really fun.

64
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:51,090  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
"The winner is... Joey Tribbiani! "

65
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,563  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
"I honestly never expected this.

66
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,930  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
I didn't prepare a speech.

67
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:06,250  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'd like to thank my parents,
who've always been there for me.

68
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:11,361  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:523
Also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..."

69
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:13,130  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm fourth?
- Jeez!

70
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,852  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look at you with your
maple syrup award!

71
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:21,169  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:523
Maybe you don't tell anyone
about this?

72
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:24,205  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
No big deal.
I do that with my shampoo bottle.

73
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:25,242  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Really?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,370  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What award are you practicing for?
- Grammy.

75
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,404  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:523
For Best New Artist.

76
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:37,363  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
The Soapies people called today.
I also get to present an award.

77
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:40,530  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you'll get on stage
even if you don't win.

78
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:47,125  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
- You don't think I'll win?
- Of course I do.

79
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:51,721  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
But Favorite Returning Character?
That's a tough category.

80
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:55,408  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're up against the guy who
survived his own cremation.

81
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:59,529  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I know I might not win.
But it's just... .

82
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,725  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:523
I've never been nominated.
I want it so much.

83
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:04,405  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
You'll probably get it.

84
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:08,167  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you should start practicing
your "gracious-loser" face.

85
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:12,001  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
When the cameras are on you,
you want to look disappointed.

86
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:15,727  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
But also that your colleague
deserved to win. Like:

87
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,088  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know?

88
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:26,207  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You practice losing the Grammys too?
- No, at the Grammys, I always win.

89
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:34,280  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hey!
- How'd your date go with Jake?

90
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:37,365  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
Great. We couldn't keep
our eyes off each other.

91
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:42,527  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
Every once in a while, he'd lean over,
stroke my hair, then touch my neck.

92
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,690  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Stop it. You're getting me
all tingly.

93
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,005  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
All I could think of was,
is he gonna kiss me?

94
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,806  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Did he?
- I'm a lady. I don't kiss and tell.

95
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,162  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
But this hickey speaks for itself.

96
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,283  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, I got it. I got it.

97
00:06:56,732 --> 00:07:00,645  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
I like him so much, I feel like
I've had 10 drinks today.

98
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,080  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've only had six.

99
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:07,881  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:523
I haven't had that feeling since
I first went out with Chandler.

100
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:13,003  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'll never have that feeling again.
- You sound like a guy.

101
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:17,091  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, a guy would say, "I'll never
get to sleep with anyone else. "

102
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,687  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll never sleep with anyone else!

103
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:25,643  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm so busy planning the wedding,
I forgot about what I'll give up.

104
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,801  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll never have a first kiss again.

105
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,208  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:486 Y2:523
You'll have a last kiss.

106
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,642  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can I ask you something? Has
a guy ever had a crush on you?

107
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,843  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

108
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:47,122  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:523
A kid in my class said
he's in love with me.

109
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:48,287  X1:301 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa!

110
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,921  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Whoa, what?
- Ross has a boyfriend!

111
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:53,848  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
I do not have a boyfriend.

112
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:57,806  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's a guy in one of my classes
who has a crush on me.

113
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,525  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Really?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,292  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid... .

115
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:06,002  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...

116
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:08,772  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
...sexy-professor vibe?

117
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,284  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not right now.

118
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:18,607  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:523
The point is, my natural charisma has
made him fail his midterm.

119
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:20,723  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now I feel bad for the kid.

120
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:24,083  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:523
I had a crush on a teacher once,
and it was so hard.

121
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:28,371  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
I couldn't concentrate.
I blushed every time he looked at me.

122
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:31,689  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
You remember what it's like
to be 19 and in love.

123
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,682  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I can cut him some slack.
- Yeah.

124
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:41,887  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
- How'd you get over that teacher?
- I didn't. I got under him.

125
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:44,601  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:523
Problem solved.

126
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,441  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Bye, Phoebe.
- Okay, bye.

127
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:58,330  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:444 Y2:523
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

128
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:08,571  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
We said goodbye at the door
so as not to flaunt our new love.

129
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:12,367  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.

130
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,847  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
I've thought about it.
You know what?

131
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,202  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm okay, not having that
new-relationship feeling.

132
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:20,962  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I miss you already!
- I miss you too!

133
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:28,485  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's great, but I wouldn't
trade what I have for that.

134
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,765  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'll be with Chandler the rest
of my life. That makes me happy.

135
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:38,123  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come sit down. We're talking
about how our relationship's deep...

136
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,926  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and meaningful.
It is, don't you think?

137
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,281  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, totally.

138
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,488  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:523
Pull my finger.

139
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:55,360  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Favorite Returning Male...
- This is my category!

140
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,164  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Got your speech?
- Got my speech.

141
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:58,725  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Got your gracious-loser face?

142
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:04,325  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Try to remember, if you win,
you have to hug me.

143
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,364  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can I squeeze your ass?

144
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,687  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
On TV?

145
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:10,641  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah!

146

155
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:05,371  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:523
Any one of the brilliant actresses
nominated for this award...

156
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:10,003  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
...deserves to take it home.
Unfortunately, only one can.

157

The nominees for

And from <i>Days of Our Lives, </i>
Jessica Ashley.

161
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,570  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:488 Y2:523
And the winner is:

162

Jessica Ashley from <i>Days of Our Lives. </i>

163
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:39,289  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
Unfortunately, Jessica
couldn't be with us tonight...

164
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,960  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
...so I'll accept this award
on her behalf.

165
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,212  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:486 Y2:523
And I'm sure that Jessica...

166
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,602  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
...wants to thank my parents...

167
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:52,888  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
...who always believed in me.

168
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:55,050  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
She'd also like to thank my friends:

169
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:59,291  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:523
Chandler, Monica, Ross,
Phoebe and Rachel...

170
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,483  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
...who's sitting right there.

171
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,730  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why'd we rush out so fast?

172
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:20,050  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:523
We had to get out of there
because... Look what I won!

173
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:24,929  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. You stole her award!

174
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:28,841  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, no, no. I'm accepting it
on her behalf.

175
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:32,047  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
I don't think you know
what "behalf" means.

176
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:36,251  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:523
Sure I do. It's a verb.
As in "I be half-in' it"!

177
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:44,450  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You've got to take this back.
- I should've won. I really wanted it.

178
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:48,924  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
She didn't care enough to come to the
thing. It could also be a Grammy.

179
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,607  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, Joey.

180
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:57,441  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:523
No one saw me take it.
There's a whole table of them.

181
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:00,047  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you want an award you didn't win?

182
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:04,490  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!

183
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:09,087  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
If I put it up, when people come over,
they'll see it...

184
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,725  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and think I won it.

185
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:13,844  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, it says
"Best Supporting Actress. "

186
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:16,202  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can scratch that right off.

187
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,761  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:523
This is wrong.
You have to take it back.

188
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:24,250  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
You don't want to win an award
this way. You're very talented.

189
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:29,441  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Someday you'll win one of these for
real and that one will mean something.

190
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,645  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Oh, all right.
- All right? Thank you.

191
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,643  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'll take it back tomorrow.

192
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,680  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
If I can't have it,
you can't have it!

193
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,046  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Professor Geller?
- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?

194
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:05,489  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know I didn't do well
on my midterms and stuff.

195
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:08,729  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
But I was hoping you could
change my grade.

196
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,287  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
And why, exactly, would I do that?

197
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:13,603  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because I'm in love with you.

198
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,208  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

199
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:21,881  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. I'm all in love
with you and stuff.

200
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,612  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:523
- So could you change my grade?
- No!

201
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:29,643  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why not? You changed Ned's grade.

202
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:33,771  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's different. Because he was
actually in love with me.

203
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,845  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, he's not!
He's totally yanking your chain.

204
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,612  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:523
He's done this with
three other teachers.

205
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:43,488  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What?
- He's got a girlfriend.

206
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,045  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe someone
would do that for a grade.

207
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,446  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

208
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:50,971  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's awful.

209
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,080  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

210
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:59,809  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

211
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,924  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
I keep thinking about all
the things I won't have.

212
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,925  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's freaking me out.
I don't know what to do.

213
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,247  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:486 Y2:523
Don't sweat it.

214
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:12,003  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Chandler's not around, so get it
out of your system. That guy's cute.

215
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,210  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:523
Come on, I'm serious.

216
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:20,604  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I've got to talk to him about this.
- That's the last thing you want to do.

217
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:24,402  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Why?
- Because you're marrying him!

218
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,009  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
You gotta help me out here.

219
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:30,763  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
I've never been engaged.
I've never really been married.

220
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,532  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can only tell you
what my mother told me.

221
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:37,845  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
When you have doubts or fears or
anxieties about a relationship...

222
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,606  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
...don't communicate them
to your husband.

223
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:45,164  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not supposed to share
my doubts and fears...

224
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:48,284  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
...with the guy I'm spending
the rest of my life with?

225
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,130  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is correct. Yes.

226
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:54,490  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're supposed to put all that stuff
in a little box in your mind...

227
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:55,886  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and lock it up.

228
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,570  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Your mother told you this?

229
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:03,129  X1:068 X2:649 Y1:444 Y2:523
The woman who married a bunch of times
and killed herself when you were 13?

230
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:05,925  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, you're right.

231
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,851  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell Chandler.
Hurry, before it's too late!

232
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:13,568  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait! Does this also mean that
putting out doesn't get you love?

233
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,570  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:523
- I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
- Wait, wait.

234
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,321  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
Rach, please be cool, okay?
I work with this woman.

235
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:27,324  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, I'm totally cool.

236
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:29,322  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come in.

237
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:31,887  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Jessica.

238
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,167  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Jess.

239
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,640  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is my friend Rachel.

240
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:37,365  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hi.
- What's up?

241
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,930  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
Here's your Soapie.
I accepted it for you.

242
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:48,011  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God. I won?
Do you have any idea what this means?

243
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:54,329  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're not gonna put it
on your shelf or anything?

244
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:58,724  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I try to save that for real
awards. Now if you'll excuse me?

245
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,570  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Take it back?
- Absolutely.

246
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:10,085  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, you do!

247
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,770  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Honey?
As we get closer to the wedding...

248
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,440  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
...is there anything
you'd like to share?

249
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:22,401  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. I think the centerpieces
are too big.

250
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:25,331  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're wrong.
The centerpieces are fine.

251
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:30,726  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Do you ever get scared at all?
- Kind of. They're really big.

252
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:37,487  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Doesn't it freak you out that you'll
never be with anybody new again?

253
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:39,248  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

254
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,211  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you so much.

255
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:47,320  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sometimes it bothers me that
I'll never have that feeling.

256
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,523  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
When you first meet someone...

257
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:53,128  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and it's new and exciting.
You know that rush?

258
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:58,520  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, when I first meet somebody...

259
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:02,930  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
...it's mostly panic, anxiety
and a great deal of sweating.

260
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:06,124  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. But you're a guy.

261
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:10,371  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Aren't you freaked out that you'll
never sleep with anybody else?

262
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:12,927  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sleeping with somebody, no.

263
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:16,920  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid,
even more sweating.

264
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:19,526  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:523
Even with me?

265
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:24,123  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was dangerously dehydrated the
first six months of our relationship.

266
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:30,447  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
For me, the rush is knowing that we'll
be together the rest of our lives.

267
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,409  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

268
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:38,403  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Knowing you're having these thoughts,
we're back to panic, anxiety and...

269
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:41,888  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I'll definitely need
some kind of sports drink.

270
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,562  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come here. Oh, you don't
have to worry.

271
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:52,323  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
Besides, you know what? I'll have
a lot of new things with you.

272
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:56,844  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
The first time we buy a house. Our
first kid. Our first grandkid.

273
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,407  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:523
Water. Water. Water.

274
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:04,084  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:523
Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you
for a moment?

275
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:11,170  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
That was a great lecture today.
Did you get a little haircut?

276
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:14,808  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
Do you love it?

277
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,045  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
I want you to know I'm
changing your grade back.

278
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,527  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? Why?

279
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:25,322  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know what you're trying
to pull here. It won't work.

280
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:29,730  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not trying to pull anything.
Look, I love you, dude.

281
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:34,924  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not even gonna talk about this.
This little "thing" is over.

282
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:39,643  X1:085 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know you have a girlfriend.
And I know about the other professors.

283
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:43,168  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:523
How do you think that makes me feel?
You used me!

284
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:45,681  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:523
You don't love me and you never did!

285
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,360  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:523
Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.

286
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,403  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll be right with you.

287
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,843  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't make this worse and I'll
give you a "C. " Shall we?

288
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:07,764  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'll be out in a second.

289
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,721  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
"It's just so unexpected!

290
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:21,925  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'll tell you, it's such
an honor to just be nominated...

291
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:24,407  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
...for a Nobel Prize.

292
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:30,125  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:132
And, you know, to win one
for a massage!

293
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:34,286  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:054 Y2:132
Especially just after winning a
Tony Award for Best Actress..."

294
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,244  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:054 Y2:089
Our reservations are at 8.

295
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:39,922  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:133
"...in <i>Reservations at Eight</i>
by Neil Simon.

296
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:43,727  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:054 Y2:132
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you for the words. "

297
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:46,932  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:054 Y2:132
Finish this later.
We're gonna be late.

298
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:50,329  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:054 Y2:133
Please don't play the music.
Just one more thing.

299
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:54,127  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:054 Y2:133
Okay. "Live from New York,
it's <i>Saturday Night</i>! "
