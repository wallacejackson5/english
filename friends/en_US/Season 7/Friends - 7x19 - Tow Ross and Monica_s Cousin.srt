1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,092  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, hey! How was your audition?

2
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:10,729  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, do I know you?

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,407  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing?

4
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,128  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!

5
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:18,283  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
You got it?

6
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:21,883  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?

7
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:25,529  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:523
A big-budget period movie about
three Italian brothers...

8
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:29,368  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
...who come to America at the turn
of the century. It's classy.

9
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,572  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,527  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:486 Y2:523
The "next-next"?

11
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:40,482  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:523
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.

12
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:42,604  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
This guy's right after him.

13
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:46,803  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello?

14
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:52,565  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!

15
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:53,808  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
They loved me!

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,368  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
They want to see you again tomorrow.

17
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,564  X1:190 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
- My God!
<i>-There's just one thing. </i>

18
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:03,322  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?

19
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,728  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:523
Are you kidding me? I never
rent a movie without it!

20
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,489  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh.

21
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:15,087  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, let me call you back.

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,803  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.

23
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,207  X1:290 X2:425 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Wow!
- I know.

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:25,328  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

25
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:29,083  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:486 Y2:523
The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin

26
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,522  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
English Subtitles by
SDI Media Group

27
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,361  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:054 Y2:133
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?

28
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:11,332  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:054 Y2:128
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.

29
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:14,326  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:054 Y2:132
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.

30
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,133  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:054 Y2:095
A "no sex" pact, huh?

31
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:21,243  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:054 Y2:132
I have one of those with
every woman in America.

32
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,325  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:054 Y2:132
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?

33
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,928  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:054 Y2:133
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.

34
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:32,324  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:054 Y2:130
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

35
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:35,451  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:132
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?

36
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:38,042  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:523
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...

37
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:39,646  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're probably right.

38
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,726  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:054 Y2:127
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

39
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,852  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Subtle, guys.

40
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:50,162  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

41
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:54,127  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:133
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.

42
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:59,011  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:054 Y2:133
Okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.

43
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,044  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Sorry.

44
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:04,604  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
We have to throw her a shower?

45
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,441  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?

46
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,967  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't know.

47
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:19,052  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.

48
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,483  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
Nudity's really important
to the story.

49
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:23,763  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's what you say about porn.

50
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:26,848  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.

51
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,966  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:523
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.

52
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:33,562  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:523
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!

53
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:39,168  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.

54
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:42,445  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.

55
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:45,332  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.

56
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:49,327  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:523
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.

57
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,683  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's really sweet and tender.

58
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:54,009  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Plus, everyone will see your thing!

59
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,769  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
When can we have this shower?

60
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:03,130  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.

61
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,370  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.

62
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:09,133  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.

63
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:12,446  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
If we make it yesterday, we're done!

64
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:15,168  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.

65
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:18,132  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.

66
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,051  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:486 Y2:523
There's too much to do.

67
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:22,721  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:523
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!

68
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,845  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,486  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:486 Y2:523
Just calm down, woman!

70
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:31,970  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, I already did.

71
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,482  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, then I need to calm down.

72
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,692  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.

73
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:42,932  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:523
We have two days to plan this party.
We need to make fast decisions.

74
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,652  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where will we have it?

75
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,407  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Here. What time?
- 4:00. Food?

76
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:50,685  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Great! Very Monica.

77
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,123  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:523
- And chili!
- You went one too far.

78
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,524  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Flowers or balloons?
- Both.

79
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:58,729  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:523
- We're paying for this.
- Neither.

80
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:04,125  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:523
- What should we do for a theme?
- Lusts of the Flesh!

81
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:08,765  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?

82
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:17,329  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.

83
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,531  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, boy. Me too.

84
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:25,122  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
and broke up for a few hours.

85
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:28,445  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
Technically, we could have sex again.

86
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,288  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?

87
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:35,007  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.

88
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:36,487  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's me. Come on.

89
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,964  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.

90
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,209  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:486 Y2:523
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!

91
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,523  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Shrill? The wedding is back on.

92
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,845  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:523
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.

93
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:54,405  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

94
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,524  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:523
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:16,926  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.

96
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,681  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?

97
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:25,681  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.

98
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,963  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:523
Chandler, she's our cousin!

99
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:31,051  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.

100
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:34,529  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.

101
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,121  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
Say something.

102
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,690  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:523
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.

103
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,683  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Fine. She can stay at my place.

104
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,043  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does Cassie look like now?

105
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:46,845  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.

106
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,651  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
This Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?

107
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,684  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wafer-thin ice.

108
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,088  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, I'm back.

109
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,090  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi, Joey.

110
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,568  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
Will I read the same scene again?

111
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:07,010  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.

112
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,566  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, great.

113
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,768  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'd have been perfect for this part.

114
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,249  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!

115
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:20,124  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.

116
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,529  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
End scene.

117
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:30,930  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wasn't that fun? We did
a little improv there. Yeah!

118
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,725  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, you were saying?

119
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:36,441  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:523
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.

120
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,689  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow! Sure! That's great.

121
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:41,043  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.

122
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,245  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.

123
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,723  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that barn is not too cold.

124
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,888  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
Perfect. There's one more thing.

125
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:57,042  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's important to the director that
everything in the movie's authentic.

126
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,969  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
In your love scene with Sarah...

127
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:04,729  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:523
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.

128
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:05,769  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
So... .

129
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,285  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:523
So... what?

130
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:15,204  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
So, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...

131
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,923  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
...be authentically, anatomically...

132
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,727  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?

133
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:23,167  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes!

134
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,167  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
No. What?

135
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:31,852  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:523
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be... .

136
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,281  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bar mitzvah-ed?

137
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,688  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:523
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.

138
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:41,882  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
But you are?

139
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,488  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You told them you weren't?
- That's right.

140
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:46,681  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow!

141
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,928  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?

142
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:58,207  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.

143
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:02,207  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.

144
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,927  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.

145
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,522  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
You figure out how to do it later.

146
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:13,330  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning to...

147
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,444  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
...grow a turtleneck.

148
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:25,847  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...

149
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:29,762  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.

150
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,487  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?

151
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:36,483  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have to call my agent and
tell her I can't do the part.

152
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,406  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Unless... .

153
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,043  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:523
Unless what?

154
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:46,246  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...

155
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,647  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:523
...fashion.

156
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:54,531  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

157
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,611  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
Off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...

158
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:01,442  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:523
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.

159
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:11,642  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:523
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.

160
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:15,482  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
We get mahogany boxes and
carve everyone's names in them.

161
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,282  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:523
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.

162
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:23,163  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Okay.

163
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,689  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You take care of that.

164
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:32,205  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.

165
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:36,765  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?

166
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,532  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

167
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:45,083  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?

168
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,686  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have at it.

169
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:51,927  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. Turkey? That won't work.

170
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,522  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:486 Y2:523
Cheese? That won't work.

171
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:58,084  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

172
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,688  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you making him a sandwich?

173
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,328  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, it's more like a wrap.

174
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:09,684  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.

175
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:14,290  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!

176
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,602  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
We have to get her a present?

177
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,325  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

178
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,684  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.

179
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,524  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?

180
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,169  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.

181
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:45,087  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cassie?

182
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,802  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Ross!

183
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,768  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's been so long!

184
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:52,892  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
Last time I saw you...

185
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,722  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:523
...you were setting up your tent
in line for <i>Return of the Jedi. </i>

186
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:02,770  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.

187
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,443  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.

188
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:11,487  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.

189
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,964  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:488 Y2:523
But her fiancé sure stares a lot.

190
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:39,368  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

191
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:45,728  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have a knack for impressions.

192
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,891  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe after we get re-acquainted
you could do me.

193
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,452  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. No!

194
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:02,967  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
How you doing on that...

195
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,606  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
...hot dog?

196
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,613  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.

197
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:16,849  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.

198
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:21,729  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Remember the time I pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?

199
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:26,405  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're probably too old to do that now.

200
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:33,209  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.

201
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,651  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll always remember that summer...

202
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:42,408  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:523
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.

203
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,367  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
It took you that long
to figure it out?

204
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:46,847  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm a little slow.

205
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,281  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just as our children would be.

206
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,162  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Hi.
- Hi.

207
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:02,450  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

208
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,769  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you. So nice to see you.

209
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:07,652  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:523
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?

210
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,327  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?

211
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:13,853  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.

212
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:17,802  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.

213
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:21,005  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.

214
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,889  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.

215
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,569  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
- How do you know Monica?
- I was her accountant four years ago.

216
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,768  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.

217
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,251  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's great.

218
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:42,162  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:450 Y2:523
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.

219
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,727  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse us.

220
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:49,646  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.

221
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:53,363  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!

222
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:57,532  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!

223
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:08,244  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.

224
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,408  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
Those look great.

225
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:15,129  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.

226
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,972  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
- The toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.

227
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:19,322  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank God.

228
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,612  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
These are more realistic,
but perishable.

229
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:27,570  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:523
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.

230
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,088  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

231
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:32,727  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.

232
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:38,404  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
I also did a little something in fur,
but that's really just for me.

233
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:45,286  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why don't you try these on? We'll
get a better idea of what works.

234
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:48,883  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:523
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.

235
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:58,370  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.

236
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:02,527  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.

237
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,525  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:450 Y2:523
- And?
- Delicious.

238
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,290  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:523
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!

239
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,051  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? Which one?

240
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,323  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!

241
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:30,249  X1:221 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>She's your cousin. </i>
<i>She's your cousin. </i>

242
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:36,132  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>If she knew what was going on in</i>
<i>your head, she'd think you were sick. </i>

243
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,721  X1:162 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>Or would she? </i>
<i>Let's back up for a second. </i>

244
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:50,649  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>She was the one who suggested</i>
<i>opening a bottle of wine. </i>

245
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,731  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>She was the one who</i>
<i>turned down the lights. </i>

246
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:57,892  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>She was the one that wanted to rent</i>
Logan's Run...

247
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,482  X1:177 X2:536 Y1:488 Y2:523
<i>... the sexiest movie ever. </i>

248
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,690  X1:231 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
<i>I know that look. </i>

249
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:10,045  X1:116 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>Forget it. I want it. She wants it. </i>

250
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:11,732  X1:260 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>I'm going in. </i>

251
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:23,324  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
What the hell are you doing?

252
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,530  X1:199 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>Say something clever. </i>

253
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,333  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>Okay, doesn't have to be clever. </i>

254
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,525  X1:077 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>Just has to be words. Say some words. </i>

255
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:38,330  X1:218 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>Any words will do. </i>

256
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:42,412  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>Oh, my God, this is the longest... </i>

257
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:47,010  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>... that anyone has not talked ever! </i>

258
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:52,612  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:523
<i>There is nothing you could say</i>
<i>to make this worse... </i>

259
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,531  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
<i>... so just say something! </i>

260
00:17:56,573 --> 00:18:00,122  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
I haven't had sex in a very long time.

261
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:06,406  X1:176 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>Yeah, you really shouldn't</i>
<i>have said anything. </i>

262
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,049  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:486 Y2:523
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.

263
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:15,371  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:523
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?

264
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:23,528  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?

265
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:27,328  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.

266
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,882  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.

267
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,607  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:523
You already had it?

268
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,123  X1:080 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.

269
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,405  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.

270
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:45,332  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.

271
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,330  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
Now you don't have either.

272
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,886  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
We ruined everything.

273
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:53,644  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.

274
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:57,363  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It kind of works out for the best.
- What do you mean?

275
00:18:57,613 --> 00:19:01,765  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.

276
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:06,603  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!

277
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,164  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.

278
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:23,922  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?

279
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,408  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
My whole family's from Naples.

280
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:31,568  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear... .

281
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,128  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
We just need to, uh... .

282
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,683  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leslie?

283
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:40,371  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Hey, right. Not a problem.

284
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,763  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I totally understand you need to...

285
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:46,562  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:523
...make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.

286
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,126  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
Don't you worry.

287
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,128  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have nothing to hide.

288
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:55,171  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, there you go. That's me.

289
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,648  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:523
One hundred-percent natural.

290
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:16,129  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
I tell you, that has never
happened before.

291
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,843  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?

292
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:26,732  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me stay here.

293
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,049  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:054 Y2:095
Oh, it's no problem.

294
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:47,482  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:054 Y2:089
What?

295
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:50,521  X1:143 X2:570 Y1:054 Y2:094
<i>Say something. Say anything. </i>

296
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:53,533  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:054 Y2:094
<i>Ask her out! She's not your cousin! </i>
