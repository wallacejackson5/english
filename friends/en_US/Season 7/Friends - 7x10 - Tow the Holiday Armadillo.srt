00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:03,965  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,369  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:524
I just got reservations
at Michelle's...

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,803  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and tickets to <i>The Music Man</i>
to celebrate...

4
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:11,328  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
...our first holiday
as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:14,366  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:444 Y2:524
- "Betrothed. "
- Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:24,162  X1:291 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
Pheebs?

7
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:25,852  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Skull?

8
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:27,281  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, it's my mom's.

9
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:28,972  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:31,564  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

11
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,162  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
It belonged to my mom.

12
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,843  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

13
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:41,171  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

14
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:44,567  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
And you can put candy in it.

15
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:49,923  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:488 Y2:524
Licorice?

16
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:52,567  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

17
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,370  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

18
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:59,041  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

19
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,965  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
I know Susan does every year.

20
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,926  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

21
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,725  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
And maybe I could teach Ben...

22
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,367  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

23
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:12,363  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

24
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,163  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

25
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,207  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

26
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:30,642  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:524
Lovely.

27
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,403  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:524
The One With The Holiday Armadillo

00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,965  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:052 Y2:131
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, will you...

30
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:14,692  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:524
...change your name to "Bing"?

31
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:16,962  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

32
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,403  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not?

33
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,047  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bing's weird.

34
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,970  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, hey, you guys.

35
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:30,888  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:131
My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

36
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,685  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:094
I guess I'll be moving out.

37
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:34,451  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

38
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,484  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, you will be very sad.

39
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:41,966  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:131
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- You'll be living together again?

40
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:44,767  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Why not?
- She's having so much fun with Joey...

41
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:47,168  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:132
...I assumed she'd still
be living with him.

42
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:49,887  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:052 Y2:131
Why do you think
she's having so much fun?

43
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:52,288  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:052 Y2:093
No reason, except she...

44
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,171  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:052 Y2:088
...told me.

45
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,968  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:052 Y2:127
She said she didn't want
to live with me?

46
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,773  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:094
No. No, she didn't say that.

47
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:02,567  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:052 Y2:093
I think you should talk to Monica now.

48
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,562  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:052 Y2:132
Phoebe, I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

49
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,206  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're absolutely sure?

50
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:10,768  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:052 Y2:094
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

51
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,042  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, probably?

52
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,521  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't like that word.

53
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:18,203  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:21,172  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself. "

55
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,008  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging my hopes...

56
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,847  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably. "

57
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,561  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

58
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,968  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
History teaches us nothing.

59
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,087  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

60
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:44,523  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're home.

61
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,968  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas?

62
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,767  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Drums?
- No, drums!

63
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:06,007  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
Could we get
two burritos to go, please?

64
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:12,003  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
you don't have to live with it.

65
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,164  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
We have a reservation under Bing.

66
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:17,922  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

67
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,966  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:450 Y2:524
We have tickets
to <i>The Music Man</i> at 8.

68
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,846  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

69
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,164  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is this because of the burrito thing?

70
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,805  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You need to give him money.
- It was a joke!

71
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:35,563  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

72
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,970  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

73
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:44,085  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth.

74
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,324  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, I can be smooth.

75
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,007  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're in a hurry.
If you could get us a table...

76
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:55,124  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.

77
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,164  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

78
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:02,166  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

79
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:09,523  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
You don't feel...

80
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,564  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
...like you're gonna throw up?
- No.

81
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,769  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, I do. So let's... .

82
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:18,206  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, Ben, you... .

83
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:20,762  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know what holiday is coming up?

84
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:21,883  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
Christmas.

85
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,125  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

86
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,607  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
Christmas Eve.

87
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,361  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, but also... .

88
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,286  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hanukkah!

89
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,050  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
See, you're part Jewish
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

90
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:40,847  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

91
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:42,446  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Right, but on Hanukkah...

92
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,763  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

93
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:48,642  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
Years and years ago there were
these people called the Maccabees.

94
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,091  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, that's right. Yes...

95
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,483  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
...but on Hanukkah, we sing:

96
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,968  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, it's not a contest.

97
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:05,006  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
When is Santa coming?

98
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:09,563  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:524
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

99
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:12,373  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

100
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,365  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
No Santa?

101
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,052  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Was I bad?

102
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,161  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, no, no, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

103
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:23,570  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

104
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,048  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

105
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:28,284  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're his favorite little guy.

106
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:29,892  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:524
So Santa's coming?

107
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,572  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes!

108
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,525  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:524
Santa's coming.

109
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:42,123  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

110
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,564  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:484 Y2:524
Shake his hand and give him the money.

111
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:48,726  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

112
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,563  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:486 Y2:524
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

113
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,363  X1:110 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'd be eating our soup right now.

114
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,568  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:488 Y2:524
Mustached bastard.

115
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:02,369  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
Those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

116
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,123  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Excuse me.

117
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,249  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
So you like the drums.

118
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,290  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's great.

119
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,965  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was worried that
they would create maybe...

120
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:42,289  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
...an unbearable living situation.

121
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,491  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

122
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,804  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, we already learned a song.

123
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:51,170  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ready? One, two, three, four.

124
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,764  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:484 Y2:524
Tequila!

125
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,168  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's fun.

126
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:05,968  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here you go.

127
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:08,170  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:524
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

128
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,561  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Definitely not easier with coins.

129
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,126  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

130
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,002  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Pheebs.

131
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:22,972  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.

132
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:25,841  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Pheebs...

133
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:29,688  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
...if you want to get Joey a gift
that disrupts the entire building...

134
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,889  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
...why not something more subtle...

135
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,361  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
...like a wrecking ball...

136
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:36,849  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
...or a vial of small pox
to release in the hallway?

137
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:39,846  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

138
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,243  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

139
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:45,291  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye! "

140
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,967  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I mean, it's so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

141
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:52,570  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

142
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,371  X1:087 X2:627 Y1:484 Y2:524
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

143
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,968  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

144
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,045  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe on some level.

145
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,285  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
You could just not throw the sticks
up in the air.

146
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,404  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

147
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,364  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

148
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,968  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is... .

149
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:27,812  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, what is it?

150
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:29,163  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's a...

151
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:30,641  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
...tarantula!

152
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:39,568  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:524
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

153
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:42,765  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

154
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:46,369  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

155
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,521  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:450 Y2:524
What are you talking about?
I love them.

156
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:55,412  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

157
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:58,167  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
And then my cat died.

158
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,252  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

159
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:03,172  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

160
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,492  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, isn't that adorable?

161
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,645  X1:144 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

162
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,206  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's so adorable.

163
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:13,602  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's so much fun.

164
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,327  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm glad you're having
so much fun here.

165
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,682  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait a minute.

166
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,048  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's the matter?

167
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,286  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:524
Our apartment is ready.

168
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:25,847  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
And that makes you angry because...?

169
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,562  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:524
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

170
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,407  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

171
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,848  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
...said you were having
so much fun here...

172
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:38,564  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantula is gonna change that.

173
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,330  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you get all this stuff for Joey...

174
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,922  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to try to drive me out
of the apartment?

175
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:48,368  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
You might as well
have gotten him a fish.

176
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,808  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:488 Y2:524
You know how fish freak me out.

177
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,168  X1:313 X2:402 Y1:488 Y2:524
Fish.

178
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:57,610  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:524
But it wouldn't have mattered.
We're gonna live together.

179
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,172  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's the deal.

180
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,973  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

181
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,681  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:524
But if you're having
so much fun over here...

182
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,930  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's so much more fun with you.

183
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,442  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We did.

184
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,926  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
They say, if we want,
we could see it tonight.

185
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,170  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

186
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,166  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

187
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:21,052  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

188
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,567  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Done.

189
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,688  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

190
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,963  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, these are my pants.

191
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,166  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

192
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:52,163  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
- How can I help you?
- Do you have a Santa outfit left?

193
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:54,603  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

194
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,362  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, look.
Do you have anything Christmas-y?

195
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:02,043  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

196
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:05,171  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Come on, you gotta have something.

197
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:08,606  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

198
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,650  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm a friend of Santa's...

199
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:15,566  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and he sent me here to wish you...

200
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,771  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
...a merry Christmas!

201
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,883  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

202
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,362  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
Santa was unavailable...

203
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:29,371  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:488 Y2:524
...so close to Christmas.

204
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,806  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:524
Come in, have a seat.

205
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:35,762  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

206
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,968  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

207
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:42,845  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm Santa's representative...

208
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:46,768  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:524
...for all the Southern states.

209
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,965  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:524
And Mexico!

210
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:52,972  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:524
But Santa sent me here...

211
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:56,649  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
...to give you these presents, Ben.

212
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,965  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

213
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:15,968  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wow, thanks!

214
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,532  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:524
You're welcome, Ben.

215
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,963  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas.

216
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,964  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
And happy Hanukkah!

217
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:28,370  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

218
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,765  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
You are? Me too.

219
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:36,372  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

220
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:40,403  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:488 Y2:524
You want to wander in the hall?

221
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,170  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Ben!

222
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,443  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

223
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,049  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

224
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,208  X1:310 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:524
Cool!

225
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:52,966  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:486 Y2:524
Come on, Ben.

226
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,408  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
Years and years ago...

227
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,769  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
...there were these people called...

228
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,004  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:524
...the Maccabees!
- Ho, ho, ho!

229
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,926  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas!

230
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,365  X1:301 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:524
Santa!

231
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,806  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing here, Santa?

232
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,361  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy, Ben.

233
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,685  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing here...

234
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:24,562  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:524
...Weird Turtle Man?

235
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:29,092  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

236
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,484  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
...your part-Jewish friend.

237
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,568  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

238
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,570  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
Remember?

239
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:41,883  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

240
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,849  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

241
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,611  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:486 Y2:524
You bet I did, Ben.

242
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,769  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
Put her there.

243
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:59,769  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

244
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,892  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:486 Y2:524
Ho, ho, ho!

245
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,691  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, come open more gifts.

246
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,606  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
The armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

247
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:12,762  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

248
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:15,801  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing?

249
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:19,210  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
You said you were having trouble
finding a Santa costume...

250
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,683  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

251
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:24,282  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

252
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:25,892  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why?
- Because...

253
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,766  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

254
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,292  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and you're wrecking it.

255
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:34,367  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

256
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:41,048  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

257
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:45,164  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

258
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:49,163  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

259
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:53,205  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
Santa, really?

260
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,081  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, is that okay?

261
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:58,810  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

262
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:03,164  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Then it's okay!

263
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:06,484  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

264
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,166  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:524
Say goodbye.

265
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,841  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, why does he have to go?

266
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:15,172  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

267
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:17,211  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
...Armadillo...

268
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,568  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

269
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,771  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
...the universe will implode!

270
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,563  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas!

271
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:33,602  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

272
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,571  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:524
Fine, I give up. Santa...

273
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,202  X1:241 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:524
Santa can stay!

274
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,048  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I'll stay...

275
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,649  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:524
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

276
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,882  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

277
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,169  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and learn about Hanukkah?

278
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,364  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Santa.

279
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,812  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

280
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,009  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, it's time...

281
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:02,370  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:524
...for the story of Hanukkah.

282
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:04,611  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
Years and years ago...

283
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:08,448  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

284
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,009  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas!

285
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:23,767  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, wow, look at this place!

286
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,969  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, this is terrible.

287
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,811  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
They've made so many changes...

288
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,971  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

289
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,569  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, new sconces!

290
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,171  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my God!
- What?

291
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:42,289  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember how you told me
your grandmother put up that wall...

292
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,603  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:524
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:47,003  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
And that the landlord
might find out...

294
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,244  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

295
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:52,129  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you really not know
where I'm going?

296
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,411  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
It left. It's one huge room.

297
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,564  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no!

298
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,569  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow!

299
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:03,482  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:524
See?

300
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:06,243  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
I guess we'll have to
put the wall back up.

301
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,571  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You can't, with the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

302
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:12,970  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow!

303
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,445  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
So should we start looking
for a new place?

304
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,241  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know, I'm sensing...

305
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:25,202  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:524
...that my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

306
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,088  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah?

307
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,847  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

308
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,365  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:524
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

309
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,322  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

310
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,649  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
You heard it too? You have the gift.

311
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,364  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:524
Phoebe, it's okay.

312
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,370  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
I like living with Joey.

313
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:48,968  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

314
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,492  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:524
...it's closer to work.

315
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,571  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:524
And we do have fun.

316
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:57,084  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:524
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

317
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,768  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

318
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,561  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you hear that?

319
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,281  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

320
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:09,009  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
She said since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

321
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:12,250  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

322
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:16,565  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, I do not hear that.

323
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:21,205  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

324
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:25,088  X1:164 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for... .

325
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:27,124  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

326
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,087  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

327
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,164  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

328
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,642  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
My favorite part...

329
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:38,966  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

330
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:46,487  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

331
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:50,568  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

332
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,606  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:524
...the Hanukkah candles!

333
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:07,772  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

334
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:12,972  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

335
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,370  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
I understand why Superman is here...

336
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,969  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

337
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,888  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:052 Y2:131
- You get it?
- I got it.

338
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,771  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:052 Y2:093
Back in the cage?

339
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,850  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:052 Y2:094
It's back in the cage.

340
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:39,811  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:052 Y2:093
Is the cage closed?

341
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:45,162  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:131
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby!
