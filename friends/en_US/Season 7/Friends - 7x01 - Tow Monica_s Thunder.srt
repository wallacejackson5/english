00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:05,611
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:05,852 --> 00:00:08,047
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:11,210
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar"?

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,845
Yeah, I'll take that.

5
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:14,647
What's up?

6
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:18,208
-Monica and I are engaged.
-Oh, my God.

7
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:24,961
Congratulations. Where is she?

8
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,851
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

9
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,806
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

10
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,646
I thought it was a kid yelling,
"I'm gay! "

11
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:39,649
-Can I bring her in?
-Let her stay. It's sweet.

12
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:43,647
I'm getting married!
I'm gonna be a bride!

13
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:49,369
No, I will not shut up,
because I'm engaged!

14
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:53,446
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

15
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:56,246
My fiancé will kick your ass.

16
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,690
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

17
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:05,363
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

18
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:08,848
The One with Monica's Thunder

20
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,047
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:52,249
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much. . .

22
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:55,689
. . .and thank you for being here
on my special night.

23
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:57,805
Our special night.

24
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,649
It just wouldn't be my night--
Our night. . .

25
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:05,561
. . .if you weren't here to celebrate
with me-- Us. Damn it!

26
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:09,043
It's okay,
I want this to be your night too.

27
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,885
To Monica.

28
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,850
Come on, wait, stop it.

29
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,366
Okay, to Monica.

30
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:21,130
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding, because I'm kind of musical.

31
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:25,288
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think--

32
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:28,689
Speaking of chiming in,
remember burning my apartment?

33
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,050
Yeah, you're on your own.

34
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:36,281
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

35
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,765
I can't stay too long.

36
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:43,288
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

37
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:46,046
I'm supposed to be playing
a 1 9-year-old.

38
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,121
What?

39
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,642
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1 986?

40
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:56,250
You guys don't think I look 1 9?

41
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,487
Oh, 1 9! We thought you said 90.

42
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:07,048
Okay, everybody, let's go.

43
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:12,568
Is my candy bar around here?

44
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,086
No, you ate it all.

45
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,283
I was afraid of that.

46
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:26,685
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

47
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,524
Diamond shoes.

48
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,728
You're not getting dressed.

49
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,125
Know what I mean?

50
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,567
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

51
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:45,364
There's gonna be a wedding.

52
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,091
You're gonna be the bride.

53
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:51,331
200 people are gonna be looking at you
in a clean, white dress.

54
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,645
Let's do it.

55
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,605
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

56
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,560
You're tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

57
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,603
Don't worry about it.

58
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,842
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

59
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,080
You know? It's like biology.

60
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,682
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology. . .

61
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:25,605
. . .and tonight biology failed me.

62
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:31,531
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in, okay.

63
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:37,167
First time I met Chandler
I thought he was gay

64
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:43,327
But here I am singing
On his wedding day

65
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,771
Phoebe, no.

66
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:51,251
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

67
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:57,480
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

68
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,804
Hey, you look great.

69
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,491
Thanks.

70
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,326
You okay over there?

71
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:10,690
I don't know. You know?
I feel a little. . . .

72
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,686
You know what? Never mind.
I'll be fine.

73
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:20,483
Don't worry about it. You're probably
tired, you had a lot of champagne.

74
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,210
It happens to everybody.

75
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:31,204
-Happy Monica's Night.
-Well, thank you. You too.

76
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:34,489
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

77
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,650
Well, sure,
but I get married all the time.

78
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:43,201
-You okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

79
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,685
Do you think we'll ever have that?

80
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,524
You mean "we," you and me?

81
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:53,007
Oh, no, no, no.

82
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,402
"We," you with someone,
me with someone.

83
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,204
Good, you scared me a minute.

84
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,204
I know. Shake it off.

85
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:04,205
It's just because you and l,
we were like a nightmare.

86
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:10,604
-No, but there were some good times.
-Absolutely. Like there was. . . .

87
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,406
-Surely you can think of something.
-Just give me a minute.

88
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:20,207
Oh, well, yes.

89
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,205
I can think of one good thing.

90
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:30,208
You were always good at the. . .

91
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:34,202
. . .stuff.

92
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,726
I was good at the stuff?

93
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:44,210
I really liked your hands.

94
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,010
My hands?

95
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:50,571
Way to go, guys.

96
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,808
You were really good at the stuff too.

97
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:56,405
Oh, I know.

98
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,442
Hey, you know what we never did?

99
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:03,727
Oh, no, not that.

100
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:06,964
We never had bonus night.

101
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,605
-A what?
-You know, bonus night.

102
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:12,487
Two people break up, but they
get back together for one night.

103
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:17,250
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

104
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:19,363
Yeah, yeah, we never had that.

105
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,448
No.

106
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:29,364
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

107
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:34,408
I'm sure it would be amazing. . .

108
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:37,729
. . .but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

109
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:39,644
I really. . .

110
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:42,004
. . .really. . .

111
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:44,210
. . .don't.

112
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:00,767
'Sup?

113
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,690
'Sup, dude?

114
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,132
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

115
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:13,482
You playing
a little PlayStation, huh?

116
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,805
That's whack.

117
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:20,605
PlayStation is whack.

118
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:25,006
'Sup with the whack PlayStation,
'sup?

119
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,606
Come on, am I 1 9 or what?

120
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:35,090
Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten
being the dumbest a person can look. . .

121
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:37,209
. . .you are definitely 1 9.

122
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:40,125
Come on, really. How old?

123
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,800
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

124
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:47,927
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

125
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,250
Thanks.

126
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:02,726
You've had a lot of sex, right?

127
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:07,444
When, today?

128
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,088
Some, not a lot.

129
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:17,041
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a--

130
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,250
I was unable to--

131
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:22,649
I really wanted to, but I couldn't--

132
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,323
There was an incident.

133
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,930
Don't worry about that, man.
That happens.

134
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:34,523
-It's happened to you?
-Yeah, once.

135
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:38,289
-Well, what'd you do?
-I did it anyway.

136
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,892
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

137
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:46,691
Come on.

138
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,125
Why aren't you dressed yet?

139
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,761
I wrote the best song
for your wedding.

140
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:54,240
Check this out.

141
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,688
If you get ready now, you can play.

142
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:57,927
-Really?!
-Yes.

143
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,521
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

144
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:05,163
But if you touch my guitar again, I'll
have to pound on you a little bit.

145
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:08,212
Fair enough. Get ready.
I'll get everybody.

146
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:11,210
Finally we can start celebrating my--

147
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:17,929
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

148
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:25,844
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw--

149
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,641
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

150
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:33,287
I waited my whole life
to be engaged. . .

151
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:36,689
. . .and unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

152
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:43,527
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I
hoped tonight could just be about that.

153
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,450
But it is just about that.

154
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,961
Now it's about you
getting back together.

155
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:50,732
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

156
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:55,366
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

157
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:58,729
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.

158
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:01,366
That's true.

159
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,407
-We just kissed.
-It was just a kiss.

160
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:05,846
You guys kissed?!

161
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:09,569
What does this mean?!

162
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,605
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

163
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,729
Thunder being stolen.

164
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:19,368
-Phoebe, it's nothing.
-Let's not make a big deal of this.

165
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,410
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

166
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:23,926
Oh, my God.

167
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,565
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

168
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,525
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and woman.

169
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:36,881
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

170
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:42,884
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

171
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,689
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

172
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:49,207
-What?
-You guys kissed? This is huge.

173
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:50,447
No, it's not huge.

174
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,445
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe. . .

175
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,808
. . .we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

176
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,845
We're still talking about it.

177
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,401
That, and Chandler's problem.

178
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,530
Monica, listen, listen.

179
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:07,247
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

180
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:09,249
-That would be lovely.
-You got it.

181
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:12,325
Now, I can pass for 1 9, right?

182
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,405
Yes, you can pass for 1 9.

183
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,045
-Really?
-Yes.

184
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,210
-Seriously?
-Seriously?

185
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:23,207
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31 .

186
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,804
I'm 30!

187
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,288
Joey, you are not. You're 31 .

188
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,091
Oh, crap!

189
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:39,285
So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai
tais? Maybe no more for you though.

190
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,329
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

191
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,204
Monica, this is ridiculous.

192
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:51,401
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

193
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,771
That is whack.

194
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,245
I'll play it at the wedding.

195
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,728
We'll see if they actually
let you play.

196
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,202
They tell you anything
you want to hear. . .

197
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,044
. . .Iike, "You look 1 9. "

198
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,807
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't. "

199
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,089
Monica won't take this away.

200
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,922
-Wouldn't she?
-Would she?

201
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:30,005
Would she?

202
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,728
You ate my candy bar!

203
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,124
Guess who.

204
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:48,085
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

205
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,686
What did Monica mean:

206
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,968
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

207
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:55,045
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

208
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:56,447
Still thinking about it?

209
00:13:56,692 --> 00:14:00,002
I'm serious. What did she mean
by that? "Especially you. "

210
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,089
-Who cares?
-I care.

211
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:03,645
And so do l.

212
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:10,370
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

213
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,763
Am I going to let you watch me?

214
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,041
No.

215
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:21,287
I can't believe her.
It's just so typical.

216
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:25,650
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

217
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:29,765
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

218
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:33,288
-Maybe in Paris.
-Paris?

219
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:37,929
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

220
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,087
Keep talking.

221
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,284
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love. . .

222
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:49,531
. . .not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

223
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:52,606
I love you.

224
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,646
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

225
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,446
It's Paris.
Who knows we're here?

226
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,524
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

227
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:19,042
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

228
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:23,684
You know, some good-faith money
to hold the date.

229
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:26,008
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

230
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,841
Oh, I see.

231
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:32,643
They break your heart, don't they?

232
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,611
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

233
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,724
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

234
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,605
Yeah, and if you want to look 1 9,
then you--

235
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:45,326
You got to do something
about your eyes.

236
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,250
What's wrong with my eyes?

237
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:50,649
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

238
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,972
Put some tea bags on them
for 1 5 minutes.

239
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:00,448
-That'll get rid of my wisdom?
-Maybe 1 0 minutes for you.

240
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,249
Give her the deposit, give her
the ring. I don't care.

241
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:12,768
What did you mean
when you said. . .

242
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:15,685
. . .you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

243
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:20,283
What a great apology.
And you accept it. Bye-bye.

244
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,922
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

245
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:28,647
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

246
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,844
Hey, here's a thought. . . .

247
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,327
Monica, what are you talking about?

248
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:37,569
My sweet 1 6. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

249
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:39,649
Third base.

250
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:43,048
It was all everybody could talk about.

251
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,086
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

252
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,606
We had a caricaturist.

253
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,968
Whenever I get married
Guess who won 't be asked to sing

254
00:16:56,212 --> 00:17:00,444
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

255
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:07,528
Monica, your sweet 1 6
was like a million years ago.

256
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,404
Yet here you are doing it again.

257
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,842
I don't want
to steal your stupid thunder.

258
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:14,811
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

259
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,650
Got me.

260
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,845
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

261
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,523
It'd be nice if I could
have this night.

262
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,848
I never wanted any part of your night.

263
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,565
No one was supposed to see us.

264
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:33,321
Is that why you did it in the secret
hallway, where nobody ever goes?

265
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:36,610
Rachel, I've been thinking.

266
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:40,964
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

267
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,248
I'm calling it off.

268
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:46,842
Way to save your dignity, my man.

269
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:52,603
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

270
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:55,280
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

271
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,046
Maybe you thought
you'd get married first.

272
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,441
Maybe you can't stand. . .

273
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,729
. . .that your formerly fat friend
is getting married first.

274
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:07,084
Oh, wow, that-- You know what?
That is so unfair.

275
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:09,288
Now I want to steal your thunder.

276
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:12,046
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

277
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:24,643
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

278
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,490
Well, somebody should.

279
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,363
Look, if we're gonna do this--

280
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,040
We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.

281
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,368
I see, so everybody wins.

282
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:40,684
-Who is it?
-It's Monica, open up.

283
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:44,248
Okay, Ross, stop it.
Please, wait a minute.

284
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,643
Yeah, you like that, baby?

285
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:54,361
May we help you?

286
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:59,290
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

287
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:02,444
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement. . .

288
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,847
. . .I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

289
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,246
How is that ever going to happen?

290
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:11,325
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

291
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,800
-I know why.
-You don't.

292
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:16,049
-Okay, why?
-Because I was sad.

293
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:17,641
What do you mean?

294
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:20,845
Look, I am so. . .

295
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:24,249
. . .so happy for you guys.

296
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:28,081
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

297
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,731
I'm not even close.

298
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:32,924
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

299
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:36,090
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed. . .

300
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,687
. . .when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

301
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,848
I don't care, she slept with me.

302
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:48,683
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

303
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:53,244
I'm sorry I almost made you
sleep with Ross.

304
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:00,408
I'm gonna take off.

305
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,248
-Congratulations, man.
-Thanks.

306
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:06,524
And Rachel. . .

307
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,167
. . .what can I say?

308
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,090
You missed your chance.

309
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:15,247
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

310
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,405
We thought Phoebe would leave

311
00:20:26,612 --> 00:20:29,331
But she just stayed and stayed

312
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:31,722
That's right, I'm here all night

313
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:33,451
And Chandler will never get--

314
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:36,120
Hey, here's a dollar.

315
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:39,045
Consider it a deposit.
Please sing at our wedding.

316
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,048
Thank you.

317
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:45,124
Now who will perform the ceremony

318
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:48,244
Who will perform the cer--

319
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:53,002
I'll pound on him in the morning.
