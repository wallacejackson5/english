1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:06,488  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:523
Do you realize this is the last time
we'll be here...

2
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,212  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
...as six single people?

3
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:11,246  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:18,169  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:523
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

5
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:21,763  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
The little woman. The wife.
The old ball and chain.

6
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:25,126  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Old?
- The young, hot ball and chain.

7
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,762  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Much better.
- We gotta go.

8
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:30,407  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Where?
- Get the dress and lunch with mom.

9
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,730  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey, you too?

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,049  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just heard "lunch. "

11
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,444  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

12
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:44,768  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.

13
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:47,447  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
I need to talk to you
about something.

14
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,646  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What's up?
- This may be a little awkward.

15
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:55,483  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying 128 dinners tomorrow.

16
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,851  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, it's not that.

17
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,005  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

18
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,522  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:486 Y2:523
...but as Monica's older brother.

19
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,043  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
- But you're still my friend?
- Not for a few minutes.

20
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:12,252  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Right now, are you still my best man?
- No.

21
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,044  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do I still call you Ross?

22
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:23,087  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:523
You guys are getting married,
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

23
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:26,890  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
But as her older brother,
I have to tell you this:

24
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:32,050  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
If you ever hurt my little sister...

25
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:37,687  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

26
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:40,044  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I will hunt you down...

27
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,844  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and kick your ass.

28
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,853  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:486 Y2:523
What? I'm serious.

29
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:58,568  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
- I hear what you're saying...

30
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,364  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and thanks for the warning.

31
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:02,841  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
No problem.

32
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,967  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are we friends again?

33
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,441  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

34
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,848  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
You won't believe what Monica's
brother just said to me!

35
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,324  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
The One With Monica
and Chandler's Wedding

36
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:50,972  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:054 Y2:094
What you doing, Mon?

37
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,047  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:054 Y2:133
I'm listing things that
could go wrong at the wedding.

38
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,371  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I can be prepared.

39
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:02,811  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:054 Y2:132
- What are they?
- "The dresses won't get picked up...

40
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:06,329  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:054 Y2:132
...veil gets lost,
and I'm missing something blue. "

41
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,529  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm responsible for all those.

42
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,764  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:054 Y2:094
I had to go with the odds.

43
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,808  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
Remember I didn't get that part?

44
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:17,883  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
The commercial?

45
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:18,929  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
That play?

46
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,532  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:523
That other play?

47
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:22,731  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:450 Y2:523
- The movie?
- Yes!

48
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,242  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:054 Y2:132
The one about the dog
who flies planes?

49
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,326  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:091
No. But man, that one hurt.

50
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:32,526  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:054 Y2:132
- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,412  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:054 Y2:127
Back then we called it
"The Great War. "

52
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,525  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:054 Y2:094
It really was.

53
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:43,442  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:054 Y2:132
A guy they wanted backed out!
I start shooting today!

54
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,762  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations!

55
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:48,289  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Today's the dinner.
- I'll be done by then.

56
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,127  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

57
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,973  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:444 Y2:523
See you. I'm off
to fight the Nazis.

58
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:58,365  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:054 Y2:129
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWII, not WWI.

59
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,524  X1:301 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa.

60
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,571  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who was in WWI?

61
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:06,932  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go ahead.

62
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,933  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're gonna be late!
Go! Go!

63
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:14,527  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
Who did we fight in WWI?

64
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:17,202  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Mexico?
- Yes. Very good.

65
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,212  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:523
- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
- Yeah, me too.

66
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,409  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Richard, we're ready for you.

67
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,123  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey Tribbiani, Richard Crosby
is playing Vincent.

68
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,006  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'm acting with you?
- Nice to meet you.

69
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:49,212  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe this. Incredible.
You just won an Oscar.

70
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:51,531  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I didn't.

71
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:53,726  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think you did.

72
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:57,766  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:486 Y2:523
I think I lost, three times.

73
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:01,523  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Cookie? Would you...?
- No.

74
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:06,047  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
We're about an hour away
from getting the scene lit.

75
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:10,332  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Can you guys run it a couple times?
- Yeah, sure.

76
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,325  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. Let's do it.

77
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,922  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
And... action!

78
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:20,092  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
- We have to find the platoon!
- Forget it, the platoon is gone!

79
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:27,132  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What?
- Platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

80
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:31,764  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:523
What'll we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

81
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:35,608  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

82
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,964  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hang on. Joey, you keep
touching your face.

83
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,248  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Something wrong?

84
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,811  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

85
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:48,411  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought it might be
a cool character thing.

86
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:51,326  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:486 Y2:523
He's a face toucher.

87
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,246  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't think so.

88
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:01,492  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:523
Let's take it back
to Richard's last lines. Action!

89
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,721  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
No weapons, but we still have food.

90
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,651  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
Potatoes, pasta...

91
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:08,724  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and a few tins of tuna!

92
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,369  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, we gotta go!

93
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,247  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Here's a question
you never want to ask:

94
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:20,202  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can my dad borrow one of your
pearl necklaces?

95
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,966  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did he say what kind of neckline
he's wearing?

96
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,282  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

97
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:28,122  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just met him once,
but I'm guessing...

98
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,368  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
...plunging?

99
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:34,044  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:523
He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
flaunt-it kind of father.

100
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,249  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let me see if Rachel has anything.

101
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,523  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes, include more people.

102
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:45,247  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you realize that tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

103
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,404  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have a date tomorrow night.

104
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:52,692  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I can't believe we made it.
- Don't sound so surprised.

105
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,332  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, but... .

106
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,562  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Nothing.
- What?

107
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:01,964  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, honestly?
Ever since we got engaged...

108
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,886  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I've waited for you to flip out.

109
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,567  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honestly? Me too.

110
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,806  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Really?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:13,329  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think that something
will come up and I'll...

112
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,321  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
...go all Chandler.

113
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,373  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:444 Y2:523
- But nothing has.
- I'm so glad.

114
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:21,252  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thank you for staying
so calm during this.

115
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:23,609  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's made me stay calm.

116
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,804  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:486 Y2:523
I could've been worse.

117
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:28,932  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll be right there.

118
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,803  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:523
<i>Before Saturday, you've reached</i>
<i>Monica and Chandler. </i>

119
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:43,683  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>But if you're calling after Saturday, </i>
<i>you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing. </i>

120
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,011  X1:151 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>Please leave a message for... </i>
<i>the Bings! </i>

121
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:04,811  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maureen!

122
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:09,403  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
- This is my cousin, Maureen.
- We're the Bings.

123
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,132  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.

124
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,005  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!

125
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,804  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wow, Monica.

126
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,682  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:523
So you know, I had my
older-brother talk with Chandler.

127
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,207  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is that?

128
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,407  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I told him that if he ever hurt you...

129
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:34,328  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:523
...I would hunt him down
and kick his ass.

130
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:40,404  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:523
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

131
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,803  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
I would kick his ass!

132
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:47,485  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ross, please, my makeup!

133
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,923  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Chandler.
- Mom.

134
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:54,607  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks for wearing... something.

135
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:01,443  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is so exciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

136
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:07,364  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just think, soon there will be
lots of little Bings.

137
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:15,329  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe I'm going back
to get spit on again.

138
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:19,208  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're lucky, the people
who spit on you are famous.

139
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:23,723  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Who spits on you?
- I don't want to talk about work.

140
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:29,052  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack Geller.

141
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,922  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Are you his mother or father?

142
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,811  X1:307 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jack!

143
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,247  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:486 Y2:523
What? I've never seen one before.

144
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,683  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:523
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.

145
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:44,010  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wasn't even able to act
like I'm okay with it.

146
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:49,089  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hello, all.

147
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:52,007  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi... Dad.

148
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,690  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi, Mr. Bing.

149
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:00,085  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Nora.
- Charles.

150
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,532  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
- It's so great to see you both here.
- Yes.

151
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,288  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although we may be seeing
too much of some people.

152
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:14,090  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:523
Aren't you too old
to wear a dress like that?

153
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,292  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
Don't you have too much penis
to wear a dress like that?

154
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,571  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

155
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:26,687  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

156
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:30,289  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
You could kick anyone's ass
you want to.

157
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,693  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks, you guys.

158
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,247  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Rach, Rach?
- Yeah?

159
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:42,327  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
Talk to Chandler's dad and
keep him away from Chandler's mom.

160
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:46,691  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:523
- What's he look like?
- A man in a black dress.

161
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:57,322  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm Rachel, a friend of
Monica and Chandler's.

162
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,525  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'm Amanda.
- Oh, I get it.

163
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:03,890  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:484 Y2:523
"A man, duh! "

164
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,364  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
Could I have your attention?

165
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:15,491  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm Ross Geller.
- Dr. Ross Geller.

166
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:20,281  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dad, please. As I was saying...

167
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:23,093  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:523
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.

168
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:26,325  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:486 Y2:523
And I'm the best man.

169
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:30,882  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
This marriage
is doubly special for me...

170
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:34,842  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because not only is the groom
my best friend...

171
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:39,524  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
...but the bride is my little sister.

172
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:44,725  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
She's the greatest sister
a guy could ask for.

173
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,492  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
Please join me in raising a glass...

174
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,805  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:523
...to the couple we're
here to celebrate.

175
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:55,284  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:444 Y2:523
- To the Bings.
- To the Bings!

176
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,289  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna steam my dress.

177
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,001  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who will make sure nothing
happens to it?

178
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,892  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'll do it.
- Who wants it? Anybody?

179
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:13,683  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I said I'll do it.
- Nobody?

180
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,812  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
- All right, I'll do it myself.
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

181
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:21,483  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big help tonight.

182
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:25,169  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thanks for helping
my grandmother get to the hotel.

183
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:29,406  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
- Okay. Sorry.

184
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:32,692  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:523
What grandmother?

185
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:40,169  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Where have you been?
- Taking my parents to the hotel.

186
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:42,404  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Going back to work?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:46,089  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Nice shades.
- Lf I wear these in my scenes...

188
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:48,602  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I won't get spit in my eyes.

189
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:54,487  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban
was the official sponsor of WWI.

190
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:57,926  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Great! All right!

191
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,971  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll see you later.

192
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,410  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Where's Chandler?
- I think he's in Rachel's room.

193
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:06,092  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler?

194
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,805  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Is Monica here?
- She's steaming her dress. Why?

195
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,487  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I think Chandler's gone.
- What?

196
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:41,167  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
- He left that.
- "Tell Monica I'm sorry. "

197
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,684  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

198
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,282  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's up?

199
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,882  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Tell Monica I'm sorry. "

200
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,092  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
Tell her yourself.

201
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,725  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?

202
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,441  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe it's not what we think.

203
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,322  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
"Tell Monica I'm sorry
I drank the last of the milk. "

204
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:13,204  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Or maybe he was writing to tell
her that he's changed his name:

205
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,411  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Tell Monica, I'm Sorry. "

206
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:23,608  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It means he freaked out and left!
- Don't be so negative!

207
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:29,207  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
Good God, isn't it possible that
"Sorry" is sitting in there right now?

208
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:34,127  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

209
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,809  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

210
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:41,483  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

211
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,725  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
But, if you don't find him
and bring him back...

212
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:49,125  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

213
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,485  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
I will find him.

214
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:58,650  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey? Can you
go through these lines with me?

215
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:01,771  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

216
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:06,170  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Just the last two pages.
- All right.

217
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,965  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I found the picture!

218
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,971  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
Picture? What picture?

219
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,131  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
The picture of my wife
I found in your pack.

220
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:22,809  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Could you lower the script?
- I don't want to.

221
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:27,886  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
I need to see your face so
I can play off your reaction.

222
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,046  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, look.

223
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:34,684  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know you're great
and play all those Shakespeare guys...

224
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,003  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:523
...but you're spitting
all over me, man.

225
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:40,730  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Of course I am!
- You know you've been spitting?

226
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,123  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's what real actors do.

227
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:47,610  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

228
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:50,925  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
And when you enunciate, you spit!

229
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:55,441  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wow. Didn't know that.

230
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,524  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

231
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:02,126  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
Picture? What picture?

232
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:14,128  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, I haven't seen him.

233
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,285  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Damn.
- He's getting married tomorrow, right?

234
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,127  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

235
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,525  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:523
- See you at the wedding.
- I wasn't invited.

236
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:28,330  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then we'll see you the
day after tomorrow.

237
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:32,612  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mom? Dad?

238
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,051  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing here?

239
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:38,603  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:523
We thought we'd see what
the fuss is all about.

240
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:42,368  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I see why the girls like coming here.
- Why?

241
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:45,207  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
The sexy blond behind the counter.

242
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:54,401  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Gunther?
- She just added him to her list.

243
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:58,922  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Your list?
- Of people we're allowed to sleep...

244
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:01,204  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know what the list is.

245
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:04,367  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come on, sit down.
Have a cup of joe.

246
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,969  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.

247
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:11,449  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you see Chandler,
tell him I'm looking for him.

248
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:15,845  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
And if you see Rita Moreno,
let her know I'm looking for her.

249
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:22,406  X1:296 X2:418 Y1:488 Y2:523
Action!

250
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,411  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I found the picture!

251
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:29,924  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:523
What picture?

252
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,925  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
A picture of my wife, in your pack!

253
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:37,133  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:482 Y2:523
You went through my personal property?

254
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,809  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why do you have a picture of Paulette
in your pack?

255
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,130  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:486 Y2:523
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...

256
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,124  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
...for two years!

257
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,927  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cut! Wonderful!

258
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,007  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:486 Y2:523
Great scene, huh?

259
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:01,723  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
You were awesome. In that
last speech, you soaked me.

260
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:05,251  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Tomorrow's call sheet.
- I'm not working tomorrow.

261
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:08,405  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You are now.
- No, you gotta get me out of it.

262
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,803  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have plans. Important plans!

263
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:22,448  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Still no word from Chandler.
- Oh, man.

264
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,924  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th.

265
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:29,329  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, well there's one down.

266
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,530  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm getting married today!

267
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:39,722  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

268
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,367  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
My day is finally here!

269
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,527  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
She might not even notice he's gone.

270
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,328  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna start getting ready!

271
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:56,932  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:523
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!

272
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:00,125  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
She'll be in the gown,
and he won't show up.

273
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:03,126  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then she'll
have to take off the gown...

274
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,893  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
Stop it. You can't do this here.

275
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:08,886  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

276
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:11,488  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's just so sad.

277
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,605  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.

278
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,890  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:523
- She'll know something's wrong.
- I know. I know.

279
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,291  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:486 Y2:523
There's no tissue.

280
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,888  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can you grab me some toilet paper?

281
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:26,881  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

282
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:30,081  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
I found one.

283
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,482  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

284
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:36,490  X1:285 X2:430 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, God.

285
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,690  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I have another one?

286
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:43,046  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

287
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,884  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you need some floss?

288
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:53,088  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't imagine what will happen
if he doesn't show up.

289
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,766  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:486 Y2:523
Here's a whole bunch.

290
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:57,089  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:523
She'll be at the wedding waiting...

291
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,689  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and people will be whispering,
"That poor girl. "

292
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:04,124  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:523
Then she'll have to come back here
and live alone.

293
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,130  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Oh, my God.
- What?

294
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:11,572  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
There was a pregnancy test in the
garbage, and it's positive.

295
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,164  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Monica's pregnant.

296
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,966  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I guess she won't be totally alone.

297
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:25,442  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:054 Y2:089
<i>Next time on</i> Friends:

298
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:28,412  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:054 Y2:130
- We've gotta tell her.
- No, we can't.

299
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:30,166  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:054 Y2:095
She's getting ready.

300
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:32,284  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:054 Y2:095
Can't you stall her?

301
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:35,326  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:054 Y2:095
I'm never gonna get married.

302
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:40,882  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:054 Y2:133
We've just got one scene with you two,
and Richard is a pro.

303
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,450  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:054 Y2:127
- Are you drunk?
- No!

304
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:44,642  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:054 Y2:094
Yes, you are!

305
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:47,129  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:054 Y2:094
All right.

306
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:49,325  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:054 Y2:128
- How's Chandler?
- Great!

307
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,012  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:054 Y2:127
- Where are you?
- On the set.

308
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,125  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:054 Y2:133
It's turning into the worst
wedding ever.
