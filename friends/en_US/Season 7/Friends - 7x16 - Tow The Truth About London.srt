00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,009  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi! Hi, Ben.

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:07,403  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- We have a bathroom emergency.

3
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:08,846  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go ahead.

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:14,251  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:524
Before we do, are any of Joey's
special "romance" magazines in there?

5
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:19,087  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Okay, all clear.

6
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,085  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:486 Y2:524
Thanks, Phoebe.

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,687  X1:249 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's Rachel.

8
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:26,851  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
But whatever.

9
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:30,450  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could you do me a big favor?

10
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:33,001  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:450 Y2:524
I have a meeting
at the dean's office.

11
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:35,243  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

12
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,920  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What about Monica?
- She isn't home.

13
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:42,968  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
So it would just be me alone?

14
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,651  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ben would be there.

15
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,371  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's the matter?

16
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:54,484  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,291  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's not an ex-con.

18
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:58,610  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, okay... .

19
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:01,571  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
- What do I do with him?
- I don't know, talk to him.

20
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:03,603  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

21
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:07,842  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Okay.
- Ben, come here.

22
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,971  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

23
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,088  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
Gonna be okay?

24
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:15,288  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I think so.
- I wasn't talking to you.

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,568  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One With the Truth About London

SDI Media Group

27
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:55,330  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:052 Y2:126
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

28
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:59,406  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:052 Y2:126
- You mean the spitter?
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

29
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,212  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:052 Y2:131
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

30
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,644  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
- And the third guy?
- He kept staring at your chest.

31
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:08,525  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:052 Y2:093
Can you blame him?

32
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:12,326  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:052 Y2:132
I don't like the idea of
me saying, "I do"...

33
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,563  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:052 Y2:127
...while he's thinking,
"I'd do it too. "

34
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:19,530  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Well, then we still have a problem.
- With what?

35
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:24,123  X1:065 X2:650 Y1:052 Y2:131
We need someone to perform our wedding
but they're all boring or annoying...

36
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:26,249  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:052 Y2:093
...or keep staring at the ladies.

37
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,443  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:524
You should have one of us do it.

38
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,644  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:052 Y2:132
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

39
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,130  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:052 Y2:094
No, it's a real thing.

40
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:41,126  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:052 Y2:131
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

41
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,845  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
I call it!

42
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:45,683  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:052 Y2:093
What? It was my idea!

43
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,083  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
Thank you very much, but neither
of you is marrying us.

44
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,085  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

45
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,881  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:052 Y2:132
We're having a legitimate
clergy member.

46
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,606  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:131
And when I say legitimate,
I mean gay...

47
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:00,161  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and in control of his saliva.

48
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,567  X1:073 X2:642 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, you know, when you were a baby...

49
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,964  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
...we'd hang out all the time.

50
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,930  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
I was your daddy's girlfriend.

51
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:20,242  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
But you're not anymore.

52
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,885  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:524
- No, I'm not.
- Because you guys were on a break...

53
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:27,168  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, we were not on a...

54
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:34,360  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
- When's my daddy coming back?
- Fifty-two minutes.

55
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,802  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:486 Y2:524
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

56
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,970  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

57
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:48,041  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Really? Like how?
- Well, you know, we would, um...

58
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:50,686  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
...we'd repeat everything
the other said...

59
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:54,368  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
...or we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

60
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:58,082  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
...or switch the sugar with salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

61
00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,601  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's a good one.

62
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,006  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yeah, you like that one?
- Yeah, you're funny.

63
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,560  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm funny?

64
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,047  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, thank God.

65
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:09,764  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

66
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,963  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
You take a quarter...

67
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:17,002  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and you blacken the edge, right?

68
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:20,449  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

69
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,922  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to your chin without it
leaving your face. "

70
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:28,160  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:524
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

71
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:30,244  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can I do it to you?

72
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,006  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

73
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:42,681  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
So did you find anyone
to marry you yet?

74
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:46,004  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:524
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister
called...

75
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:49,646  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
...wondering if we're still together.

76
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:53,161  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- We'll never find anybody.
- Then let me do it.

77
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:54,811  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joey...
- I've been thinking.

78
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:58,482  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

79
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,042  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

80
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:05,486  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

81
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,883  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's true.
- The most important thing...

82
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,368  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
...is, it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

83
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,082  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

84
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,568  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Plus, I love you guys and it
would really mean a lot to me.

85
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,726  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
Might be kind of cool.

86
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,042  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:446 Y2:524
- So I can do it?
- Yeah, you can do it.

87
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,522  X1:239 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right! Okay!

88
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,567  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

89
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:32,040  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait a minute.

90
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:35,126  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:446 Y2:524
Internet ministers
can have sex, right?

91
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:40,607  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:484 Y2:524
Coming.

92
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:51,087  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
I have a bone to pick with you.

93
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,804  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Uh-oh.
- Yes.

94
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,287  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ben learned a little trick.

95
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:03,088  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, did he pull the old...?
- That's right, that's right.

96
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:07,091  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

97
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:10,090  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
...so the pee goes everywhere.

98
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:14,008  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

99
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,522  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know I hate practical jokes.

100
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:20,481  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're mean, they're stupid and
I don't want my son learning them.

101
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:24,884  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

102
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:26,690  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I was barefoot.
- Oh.

103
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:32,091  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

104
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,041  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

105
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,326  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

106
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,604  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You got ordained?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:49,288  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

108
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,683  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
Our minister.

109
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,608  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

110
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:59,849  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:524
Listen, this is just
the first draft, so... .

111
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,849  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

112
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,801  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
...to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

113
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,644  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
It is a love based on
giving and receiving...

114
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,360  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
...as well as having and sharing.

115
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:21,362  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:524
And the love that they give
and have is shared and received.

116
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:26,005  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
And through this having and giving...

117
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:28,971  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and sharing and receiving...

118
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:34,811  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
...we too can share and love
and have...

119
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,243  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and receive. "

120
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:42,043  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
Should we call the spitter?

121
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:52,364  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

122
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,921  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

123
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:58,001  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was just in the neighborhood...

124
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:01,642  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I passed by your building and
thought, "What's up with Carol...

125
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,610  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and sweet little Ben?"

126
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:07,124  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's nice. Well, come on in.
- Okay.

127
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,488  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'll make some coffee
and we can chat.

128
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,484  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'd love that.
I would love that.

129
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:16,002  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:524
So where is sweet little Ben?

130
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:18,288  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:524
I would love to have a little...

131
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,210  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:524
I found him!

132
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,009  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
Very funny. Come here.

133
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:29,888  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
That is exactly why I've
come here to talk to you, okay?

134
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:32,487  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Rachel, you want sugar?
- Yes, but...

135
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:34,609  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

136
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,645  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

137
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:43,645  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

138
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,770  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

139
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,164  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Don't do that.
- "Don't do that. "

140
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:53,121  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
- "Your dad doesn't like pranks. "

141
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:55,563  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, damn it.
- "Oh, damn it! "

142
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:57,291  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524
No! Don't say that.

143
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,524  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Damn it!
- Go back to repeating.

144
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,205  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Damn it!
- Oh, crap.

145
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:02,521  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Oh, crap! "

146
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:11,324  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

147
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,529  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, okay.

148
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:19,360  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

149
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:24,325  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

150
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:28,611  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and giving..." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

151
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,525  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How about "receiving"?
- Yes!

152
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:36,888  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

153
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:41,610  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

154
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,444  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
...is that it can be about us.

155
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:47,002  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

156
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:52,643  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London,
when you hooked up.

157
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,360  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

158
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:58,530  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'll say, "began their
beautiful journey...

159
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,161  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:446 Y2:524
- There you go.
...by doing it. "

160
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:05,961  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joe.
- Okay, all right.

161
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,769  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

162
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:13,448  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

163
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,964  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Isn't that what happened to you?
- Yeah!

164
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:22,567  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I call that "London style. "

165
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,444  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
That didn't happen with us.

166
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,321  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

167
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,364  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, uh... .

168
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,089  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

169
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,760  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me and...

170
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,572  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
...we drank too much.
- Yeah, baby.

171
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:51,283  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was a gentleman and I walked her to
her hotel room and said good night.

172
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:52,768  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

173
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:56,363  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
- But then, later that night...
- Yeah, baby.

174
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,802  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:524
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

175
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,000  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

176
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,404  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:524
...9:15.

177
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:19,526  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is Joey here?

178
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:24,004  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

179
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:28,366  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're not still upset about
what that guy told you, are you?

180
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,646  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
Wouldn't you be?

181
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:34,806  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink... .

182
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,650  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
You have to let that go, okay?

183
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,804  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
You were the most beautiful
woman in the room tonight.

184
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:41,768  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

185
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:45,402  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:524
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms...

186
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,245  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:524
Whoa, what's going on?

187
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:55,402  X1:223 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
We just made out.

188
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:57,762  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We're making out?
- Not anymore.

189
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:02,207  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
- But we don't do that.
- I know, I thought it would be fun.

190
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:04,402  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
How drunk are you?

191
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:09,442  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:446 Y2:524
Enough to know I want to do this. Not
so much that you should feel guilty.

192
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:12,320  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's the perfect amount.

193
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,970  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You know what's weird?
- What?

194
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:23,442  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

195
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:27,810  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

196
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:32,481  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.

197
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,291  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, you are really fast!

198
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:46,524  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

199
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:50,401  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

200
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,646  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:450 Y2:524
- At the same time?
- Count of three?

201
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:56,611  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:486 Y2:524
One, two, three.

202
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:04,881  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

203
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,009  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

204
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,086  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, Joey, Joey...!

205
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:15,928  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

206
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,447  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie... .

207
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,608  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

208
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,005  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No!

209
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:29,801  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's cool, I'm still
with my bridesmaid.

210
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:31,525  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:524
Where are the condoms?

211
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,531  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
In my bag over there.

212
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,691  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could you leave me one?

213
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:45,848  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:524
For just you?

214
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,321  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

215
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:53,690  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right. There you go, buddy.

216
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,646  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go nuts.

217
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,171  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's what that was?

218
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:05,089  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
If I hadn't left you one, you two
might've never gotten together.

219
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,845  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Imagine if I had sent that hooker
like I was gonna?

220
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:13,081  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's like it was in the stars.

221
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:14,965  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, totally meant to be.

222
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:18,568  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

223
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:21,163  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What?
- What?

224
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:22,841  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

225
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,492  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

226
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:31,081  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

227
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:35,365  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

228
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:39,890  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wanted something stupid and
meaningless. I just wanted sex.

229
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:43,091  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
So, when I went to your
room that night...

230
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,489  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I was actually looking for Joey.

231
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,411  X1:265 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, baby.

232
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,930  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, baby.

233
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,520  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

234
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:02,490  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
You came looking for Joey?

235
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:06,850  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Were you planning on telling me this?
- No, I didn't think it was important.

236
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:09,688  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not important?
It's not important?

237
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:12,765  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him.

238
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:17,523  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

239
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:18,568  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey!

240
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:23,330  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm a man of the cloth
but I still have feelings.

241
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,329  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's no way you're
doing this wedding now, okay?

242
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:32,002  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
What? That's not fair.
It's not my fault.

243
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:33,731  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was with my bridesmaid.

244
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,923  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:524
And who's to say
I would've said yes?

245
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:38,202  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
I mean, I would've said yes.

246
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:42,330  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
You are making way too
big a deal out of this.

247
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,090  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everything worked out okay.

248
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:45,651  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's just weird, okay?

249
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:49,931  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

250
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:52,891  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:524
I need... I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

251
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:56,522  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
- It is to me.

252
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,883  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

253
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:07,329  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:446 Y2:524
- This is crazy.
- No, Robin is so gay.

254
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,090  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
- So now what have we agreed?
- No more pranks.

255
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:17,729  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What else?
- You and Daddy were not on a break.

256
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,041  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Very good.

257
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:25,211  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Rachel, what are you doing here?

258
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:28,445  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm just visiting
my good friend Carol.

259
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:31,202  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Your good friend?
- Yeah.

260
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,091  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's her last name?

261
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:36,800  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:524
Carol...

262
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,005  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:450 Y2:524
...Lesbian.
- Nice.

263
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,811  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:484 Y2:524
By the way, that line down my face... .

264
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:50,166  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
The line that prompted a student
in my last class of the day to say:

265
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:53,641  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

266
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,123  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

267
00:16:57,452 --> 00:17:00,489  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

268
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,604  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay?
- Fine. Fine.

269
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,407  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel. "

270
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,568  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

271
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:12,722  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

272
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,968  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

273
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,407  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

274
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,247  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

275
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,448  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Crap!
- I gotta go.

276
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:31,209  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:35,730  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

278
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:38,725  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nothing even happened.

279
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,442  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
I just don't want you to be upset.

280
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:44,364  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
How can I not be upset?

281
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:47,570  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

282
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:49,882  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and it turns out
she wanted you first.

283
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,930  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, for like a half an hour
one night.

284
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:56,961  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

285
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:00,928  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
We look at you and we
see you together, and it just...

286
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:04,649  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
...it fits, you know?

287
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:08,249  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

288
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:13,043  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's what you should say.

289
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:15,446  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

290
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:21,249  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

291
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:24,044  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? I could do it?

292
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,446  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd love you to do it.

293
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,651  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

294
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:35,485  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

295
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,841  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I don't remember exactly but...

296
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:44,807  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
...it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

297
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:54,410  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So you guys doing okay?
- Yeah.

298
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:58,281  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:524
We talked and Monica made me
see that I overreacted a little bit.

299
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:02,287  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Some things are more important.
- Yeah, baby.

300
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:08,601  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

301
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:11,889  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:524
...what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

302
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,570  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
Honey, dinner's ready!

303
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:24,761  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
What's my little chef
got for me tonight?

304
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:26,286  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Your favorite.
- Ho, ho, ho...

305
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:28,964  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:524
...fried stuff with cheese.

306
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:32,125  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
And lots of it!

307
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,891  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:486 Y2:524
Thanks, sweetheart.

308
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,771  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
Give me a little sugar... .

309
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,682  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

310
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,688  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
How you doing?

311
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,011  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey!

312
00:19:56,252 --> 00:20:00,689  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry to do this again, but
could you look after Ben for a bit?

313
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,484  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've got this meeting at school...

314
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:05,565  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and he asked for his
fun Aunt Rachel.

315
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:08,367  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, of course I will watch him.

316
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,489  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:486 Y2:524
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

317
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,848  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:446 Y2:524
- See you later, pal.
- Okay.

318
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,806  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.

319
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,287  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You got something on your back.
- What?

320
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,764  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's great. That is great.

321
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,281  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:131
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

322
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,285  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:052 Y2:132
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

323
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:32,485  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:052 Y2:089
That's it! Come here!

324
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,166  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:052 Y2:129
- You're in big trouble, young man!
- No, wait.

325
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,448  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:052 Y2:093
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

326
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,762  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:052 Y2:093
You guys, hold it. Seriously...

327
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,441  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, my God!
